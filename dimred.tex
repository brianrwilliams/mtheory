\section{Dimensional reduction and 10-dimensional supergravity}

In this section we demonstrate that our proposal for the action of minimally twisted 11-dimensional supergravity agrees with conjectural descriptions of twisted type IIA and type I supergravities due to Costello and Li. 

The original motivation for $M$-theory was as the strong coupling limit for type IIA string theory.
Roughly, the radius of the $M$-theory circle plays the role of this coupling constant. 
Additionally, at low energies $M$-theory is expected to be approximated by 11-dimensional supergravity in the same way that the low energy limit of type IIA/IIB string theory is type IIA/IIB supergravity. 
Combining these two pictures, various checks have been made that the dimensional reduction of 11-dimensional supergravity along the $M$-theory circle is type IIA supergravity. 

Motivated by the topological string, Costello and Li have laid out a series of conjectures for twists of type IIA/IIB supergravity \cite{CLsugra} and type I supergravity \cite{CLtypeI}. 
Their description was inspired by the model of the open and closed $B$-model topological string on a Calabi--Yau manifold. 
The open sector is holomorphic Chern--Simons theory \cite{WittenOpen} and the closed sector is called Kodaira--Spencer theory \cite{BCOV}. 
There are a few different versions of Kodaira--Spencer theory, but the shared characteristic is that they are all `gravitational' in nature; they describe fluctuations of the Calabi--Yau structure. 
From this point of view, Kodaira--Spencer theory is at the heart of the formulation of the various flavors of twisted 10-dimensional supergravity.

We begin by introducing certain variants of Kodaira--Spencer theory which will feature in the descriptions of twists of type IIA and type I supergravity.

\subsection{Kodaira--Spencer theory}

Let $X$ be a Calabi--Yau manifold; for now it can be of arbitrary complex dimension. 
Define
\deq{
  \PV^{i,j}(X) = \Omega^{0,j}(X, \wedge^i \T_X).
}
We will consider the graded space $\PV^{\bu,\bu}(X) = \oplus_{i,j} \PV^{i,j}(X)[-i-j]$ where the piece of type $(i,j)$ sits in degree $i+j$. 

For each fixed $i$, while we let $j$ vary, the $\dbar$ operator defines a cochain complex $\PV^{i,\bu}(X) = (\oplus_j\PV^{i,j}(X) [-j], \dbar)$ which provides a resolution for the sheaf of holomorphic polyvector fields of type $i$. 
The divergence operator extends to an operator of the form
\[
\div \colon \PV^{i,\bu}(X) \to \PV^{i-1,\bu}(X) .
\]

Motivated by the states of the topological $B$-model, one defines the fields of Kodaira--Spencer gravity on $X$ to be the cochain complex
\beqn\label{eqn:ks1}
\left(\PV^{\bu,\bu} (X)[[u]] [2] \, , \, \dbar + u \div\right) .
\eeqn 
Here, $u$ is a parameter of cohomological degree $+2$, which turns $\delta_{KS}^{(1)} = \dbar + u \div$ into an operator of homogenous degree $+1$. 
We also have performed an overall cohomological shift by $2$ so that $u^k \PV^{i,j}$ sits in degree $i+j+2k-2$. 
More precisely, this is a model for the $S^1$-equivariant cohomology of the states of the $B$-model on a closed disk. 
We refer to \cite{CLtypeI, CLsugra} for detailed justification for this ansatz.

\subsection{The $SU(4)$ twist of type IIA supergravity}\label{sec:SU(4)twist}

We recall the description of the $SU(4)$ twist of type IIA supergravity conjectured in \cite{CLsugra}. 
In principal, there is also a minimal, $SU(5)$ invariant, twist of type IIA supergravity but so far no description, even conjecturally, exists.
We turn to this in Section \ref{sec:SU(5)twistIIA}. 

Let $X$ be a Calabi-Yau manifold of complex dimension four. 
The complex of fields of minimal Kodaira--Spencer theory on $X$ takes the form
\brian{I have an issue with how this is organized}
\beqn
\begin{tikzcd}
                        &                          &                                     & {\PV^{0,\bu}}    \\
                        &                          & {\PV^{1,\bu}} \arrow[r, "u\div"]    & {u\PV^{0,\bu}}   \\
                        & {\PV^{2,\bu}} \arrow[r, "u\div"]  & {u\PV^{1,\bu}} \arrow[r, "u\div"]   & {u^2\PV^{0,\bu}} \\
{\PV^{3,\bu}} \arrow[r, "u\div"] & {u\PV^{2,\bu}} \arrow[r, "u\div"] & {u^2\PV^{1,\bu}} \arrow[r, "u\div"] & {u^3\PV^{0,\bu}}
\end{tikzcd}.
\eeqn
Denote this complex by $\cE_{mKS}(X)$. 
The classical BCOV action $I_{BCOV}$ follows from the general formula we gave above. 

\brian{I've commented this out below, since we should just introduce minimal BCOV in general up above}

%Clearly, the inclusion is a Poisson map, so restricting $I_{BCOV}$ to this subcomplex defines another $\Z/2$ graded Poisson BV theory referred to as minimal Kodaira-Spencer theory. Under the identification of Kodaira-Spencer theory as the closed string sector of the B-model, minimal Kodaira-Spencer theory should be thought of as consisting of those closed string fields present in the supergravity approximation.

With this in hand the conjecture of \cite{CLSugra} takes the following form.

\begin{conj}
The $SU(4)$-invariant twist of type IIA supergravity on $\RR^2\times \CC^4$ is the $\Z/2$-graded Poisson BV theory with fields \[
\alpha = \sum_n \alpha_n u^n \in \cE_{mKS}(\CC^4) \otimes \Omega^{\bu}(\RR^2).\] 
The classical interaction takes the form $I_{IIA} = \int_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} \alpha_0^3 + {\rm higher\;order\;terms}.$
%The $L_{\infty}$ structure is the natural one on the tensor product of the cdga $\Omega^{\bu}(M)$ with the $L_{\infty}$-algebra $\cE_{mKS}$.
\end{conj}

We will need a more detailed description of the classical action. 
For the moment, let us introduce some notations for the fields of this IIA model, as always we leave the internal Dolbeault degree implicit:
\begin{multline}
\eta \in \PV^{0,\bu}(\CC^4) \otimes \Omega^\bu (\RR^2), \quad \mu + u \nu \in \PV^{1, \bu}(\CC^4) \otimes \Omega^\bu (\RR^2) \oplus u \PV^{0,\bu} (\CC^4) \otimes \Omega^\bu (\RR^2) \\
\Pi \in \PV^{3,\bu}(\CC^4) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR^2), \quad \sigma \in \PV^{3,\bu}(\CC^4) \otimes \Omega^\bu (\RR^2) .
\end{multline}
We will not need an explicit notation for the remaining descendant fields. 

With this notation in hand, we have the more precise form of the action appearing in the conjecture:
\beqn\label{eqn:IIAaction}
I_{IIA} = \frac12 {\rm Tr}_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} \frac{1}{1-\nu} \mu^2 \wedge \Pi + {\rm Tr}_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} \frac{1}{1-\nu} \eta \wedge \mu \wedge \sigma + \frac12 {\rm Tr}_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} \frac{1}{1-\nu} \eta \wedge \Pi^2 + \cdots 
\eeqn
where the $\cdots$ denote terms involving higher order descendants. 

\subsection{Reduction to IIA supergravity}

We now turn back to our 11-dimensional theory. 
The first goal is to compare the dimensional reduction of our 11-dimensional theory on $\CC^5 \times \RR$
%where $X$ is a Calabi-Yau 4-fold 
with the $SU(4)$ invariant twist of type IIA on $\R^{2}\times \CC^4$. 
Doing so will require a slight modification to the description of the $SU(4)$ twist of IIA supergravity recollected in \S \ref{sec:SU(4)twist}. 

\parsec[sec:IIApot]

Recall that in the physical theory, the components of the $C$-field in 11d that are not supported along the M-theory circle become the components of the Ramond--Ramond 2-form of type IIA. However, as noted in \cite{CLSugra} components of Ramond--Ramond fields do not appear as fields in Kodaira--Spencer theory; rather it is components of their field strengths that appear. Since components of the $C$-field become components of $\gamma_{11d}$ in $\cE$ \surya{hopefully we can see this in the component fields section}, this suggests that we must modify our description of the twist of type IIA to include potentials for certain fields.

The fundamental fields of the $SU(4)$ twist of IIA supergravity were given in \eqref{eqn:IIAfields}. 
We modify the space of fields by introducing potentials for both the $\Pi$ and $\sigma$ fields. 
First, we introduce a field $\gamma \in \Omega^{1,\bu}(\CC^4) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR^2)$ (not to be confused, yet, with the $\gamma$ field in our 11-dimensional theory) which satisfies $\Pi \vee \Omega = \del \gamma$ where $\Omega$ is the Calabi--Yau form on $\CC^4$. 
This condition does not uniquely fix $\gamma$. 
There is a new linear gauge symmetry determined by $\gamma \to \gamma + \div \beta$ where $\beta$ is a ghost that we must also introduce. 
Similarly, we introduce a field $\theta \in \Omega^{0,\bu}(\CC^4) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR^2)$ which satisfies $\sigma \vee \Omega = \del \theta$, there is no extra gauge symmetry present in this condition.\footnote{Using the Calabi--Yau form we have normalized the potential fields $\gamma, \beta,\theta$ to be written as differential forms instead of polyvector fields.}

In diagrammatic detail, the potential theory we are considering has underlying cochain complex of fields
\beqn\label{eqn:IIApot}
\begin{tikzcd}
- & + \\ \hline
& {\PV^{0,\bu} (\CC^4) \otimes \Omega^\bu (\RR^2) }_\eta  \\
{\PV^{1,\bu} (\CC^4) \otimes \Omega^\bu (\RR^2)}_\mu \arrow[r, "u\div"] & u{\PV^{0,\bu} (\CC^4) \otimes \Omega^\bu (\RR^2)}_\nu \\
u^{-1}{\Omega^{0,\bu} (\CC^4) \otimes \Omega^\bu (\RR^2)}_\beta \arrow[r, "u\div"] & {\Omega^{1,\bu} (\CC^4) \otimes \Omega^\bu (\RR^2)}_\gamma  \\
{\Omega^{0,\bu} (\CC^4) \otimes \Omega^\bu (\RR^2)}_\theta &
\end{tikzcd}
\eeqn.

Recall that the original fields of the IIA supergravity model on $\CC^4 \times \RR^2$ was equipped with an odd Poisson bivector which was degenerate.
In other words, it did not define a theory in the conventional BV formalism. 
One of the key features of this new complex of fields, after we have taken these potentials, is that it is equipped with an odd non-degenerate pairing thus equipping it with the structure of a theory in the conventional BV formalism. 

The pairing is $\Res_u \frac{\d u}{u} \int^\Omega_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} \alpha \vee \alpha'$ where $\alpha, \alpha'$ are two general fields in this potential theory on $\CC^4 \times \RR^2$. 
Explicitly, in the description of the fields in \eqref{eqn:IIApot} the pairing is 
\[
\int^\Omega_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} \eta \theta + \int^\Omega_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} \mu \vee \gamma + \int^\Omega_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} \nu \beta .
\]
This pairing is compatible with the odd Poisson bracket present in the original theory on $\CC^4 \times \RR^2$. \brian{finish}

The type IIA action completely determines the action of this theory with potentials. 
One simply takes the \eqref{eqn:IIAaction} and replaces all appearances of $\Pi$ with $\div \gamma$ and all appearances of $\sigma$ with $\div \theta$. 
This yields the interaction of the potential theory
\beqn\label{eqn:IIAactionpot}
\til I_{IIA} = \frac12 \int^\Omega_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} \frac{1}{1-\nu} \mu^2 \vee \del \gamma + \int^\Omega_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} \frac{1}{1-\nu} (\eta \wedge \mu) \vee \del \theta + \frac12 \int_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} \frac{1}{1-\nu} \eta \wedge \del \gamma \wedge \del \gamma 
\eeqn
Notice that the terms involving higher descendants vanishes since these fields are set to zero in the potential theory.

%Note that there is a natural map of cochain complexes $\partial \cE_{pot}\to \cE_{mKS}$ given by the dotted arrows below:
%\beqn
%\begin{tikzcd}
%                                       & {\PV^{0,\bu}} \arrow[rrr, dotted, "\id"] &                          &                                     & {\PV^{0,\bu}}    \\
%{\PV^{1,\bu}} \arrow[r, "u\div"]       & {u\PV^{0,\bu}} \arrow[rr, dotted, "\id"] &                          & {\PV^{1,\bu}} \arrow[r, "u\div"]    & {u\PV^{0,\bu}}   \\
%{u^{-1}\PV^{4,\bu}} \arrow[r, "u\div"] & {\PV^{3,\bu}} \arrow[r, dotted, "\div"]  & {\PV^{2,\bu}} \arrow[r]  & {u\PV^{1,\bu}} \arrow[r, "u\div"]   & {u^2\PV^{0,\bu}} \\
%{\PV^{4,\bu}} \arrow[r, dotted, "\div"]        & {\PV^{3,\bu}} \arrow[r]          & {u\PV^{2,\bu}} \arrow[r] & {u^2\PV^{1,\bu}} \arrow[r, "u\div"] & {u^3\PV^{0,\bu}}
%\end{tikzcd}.
%\eeqn
%This is easily seen to be a Poisson map. We have that $I_{pot} = \partial^{*}I_{BCOV}$, so we see that $I_{pot}$ satisfies the classical master equation. Therefore, $I_{pot}$ determines an $L_{\infty}$ structure on $\cE_{pot}$, and hence one on $\Omega^{\bu}(\R^{2})\otimes \cE_{pot}$. In what follows, the $SU(4)$-invariant twist of IIA will refer to the BV theory $\Omega^{\bu}(\R^{2})\otimes \cE_{pot}$.

\parsec[sec:dimred]

We turn to the proof of the main result of this section that the dimensional reduction of our 11-dimensional theory agrees with the twist of IIA supergravity just introduced. 

We recall the notion of dimensional along a holomorphic direction following \cite{ESW}. 
Suppose that $V_\RR$ is a real vector space and denote by $V$ its complexification. 
We consider a field theory defined on $M \times V$, which is holomorphic along $V$ (in particular, this means that the theory is translation invariant along $V$).  
We consider the dimensional reduction along the projection 
\beqn\label{eqn:dimred}
M \times V \to M \times V_\RR
\eeqn
induced by ${\rm Re} \colon V \to V_\RR$.
Most relevant for us is the case when $V = \CC$ and $M$ is $\CC^4 \times \RR$, but the explicit form of the theory along $M$ is not important at the moment.

In fact, we might as well assume that $M$ is a point and that the space of fields is of the form $\Omega^{0,\bu}(V) \otimes W$ for $W$ some graded vector space. 
As properly formulated in \cite{ESW}, it is shown that the dimensional reduction along $V \to V_\RR$ is equivalent to the theory whose fields are $\Omega^\bu(V_\RR) \otimes W$. 
In other words, the dimensional reduction of the holomorphic theory on $V$ is a topological theory on $V_\RR$. 

If we put $M$ back in, the result is similar. 
Suppose the original theory is of the form $\cE(M) \otimes \Omega^{0,\bu}(V) \otimes W$.
Then, the dimensional reduction along \eqref{eqn:dimred} is the theory whose space of fields is $\cE(M) \otimes \Omega^\bu(V_\RR) \otimes W$.

An explicit model for this reduction can be described as follows. 
Suppose $V \cong \CC^n$ and place the theory on $(\CC^\times)^{\times n} \subset \CC^n$. 
The dimensional reduction along $\CC^n \to \RR^n$ agrees with the compactification of the theory along $S^1 \times \cdots \times S^1$ where one throws away all nonzero winding modes around each circle.

\begin{prop}\label{prop:dimred}
The $SU(4)$ invariant twist of type IIA on $\CC^4 \times \RR^2$ is equivalent to the dimensional reduction of the 11-dimensional along  
\[
\CC^4 \times \CC \times \RR_t \to \CC^4 \times \RR_x \times \RR_t \cong \CC^4 \times \RR^2 .
\]
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Let us denote the holomorphic coordinate we are reducing along by $z_5 = x + \im y$. 
We first read off the dimensional reduction of each component field of the 11-dimensional theory. 
Per the above discussion, this is obtained by taking all fields to be independent of $y$ and replacing $\d \zbar_5$ by $\d x$. 
To not confuse the notations of fields in 10 and 11 dimensions, we use the notation $\alpha_{11d}$ to denote an 11-dimensional field.

The reductions of the 11d fields $\nu_{11d}, \beta_{11d}$ are easy to describe. 
Recall that 
\[
\nu_{11d} \in \PV^{0,\bu}(\CC^5) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR) .
\]
The reduction of this field is a 10d $\nu$ field
\[
\nu (z_i,x,t) = \nu_{11d} (z_i, x, y=0, t) |_{\d \zbar_5 = \d x}  .
\]
Similarly, the reduction of $\beta_{11d}$ is a 10d $\beta$ field
\[
\beta (z_i,x,t) = \beta_{11d} (z_i, x, y=0, t) |_{\d \zbar_5 = \d x}  .
\]

The reduction of the 11d fields $\mu_{11d}$ and $\gamma_{11d}$ require a bit of massaging. 
We break the $SU(5)$ symmetry to $SU(4)$ to write
\[
\mu_{11d} = \mu^0_{11d} + \theta_{11d} \partial_{z_5} 
\]
where
\begin{align*}
\mu^0_{11d} & \in \PV^{1,\bu}(\CC^4) \otimes \Omega^{0,\bu}(\CC_{z_5}) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR_t) \\
\theta_{11d} & \in \Omega^{0,\bu}(\CC^4) \otimes \Omega^{0,\bu}(\CC_{z_5}) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR_t) .
\end{align*}
The dimensional reduction of $\mu^0_{11d}$ is a 10d $\mu$ field
\[
\mu(z_i,x,t) = \mu_{11d}^0 (z_i, x,y=0,t)|_{\d \zbar_5 = \d x} .
\]
The dimensional reduction of $\theta_{11d}$ is a $\theta$ field
\[
\theta(z_i,x,t) = \theta_{11d} (z_i, x,y=0,t)|_{\d \zbar_5 = \d x} .
\]

Finally, write the 11d field $\gamma_{11d}$ as
\[
\gamma_{11d} = \gamma_{11d}^0 + \eta_{11d} \d z_5
\]
where
\begin{align*}
\gamma^0_{11d} & \in \Omega^{1,\bu}(\CC^4) \otimes \Omega^{0,\bu}(\CC_{z_5}) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR_t) \\
\eta_{11d} & \in \PV^{0,\bu}(\CC^4) \otimes \Omega^{0,\bu}(\CC_{z_5}) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR_t) .
\end{align*}
The dimensional reduction of $\gamma^0_{11d}$ is a 10d $\gamma$ field
\[
\gamma(z_i,x,t) = \gamma_{11d}^0 (z_i, x,y=0,t)|_{\d \zbar_5 = \d x} .
\]
The dimensional reduction of $\eta_{11d}$ is an $\eta$ field
\[
\eta(z_i,x,t) = \eta_{11d} (z_i, x,y=0,t)|_{\d \zbar_5 = \d x} .
\]

Next, we read off the dimensional reduction of the 11d action. 
Let us first focus on the term present in BF theory which is
$\int^\Omega \frac{1}{1-\nu_{11d}} \mu_{11d}^2 \vee \del \gamma_{11d}$.
Upon reduction, this becomes 
\beqn\label{eqn:bfred}
\int^{\Omega_{\CC^4}}_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} \frac{1}{1-\nu} \mu^2 \vee \del \gamma + \int^{\Omega_{\CC^4}}_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} \frac{1}{1-\nu} (\theta \wedge \mu) \vee  \del \eta 
\eeqn

Next, consider the cubic term in the 11d action $J = \frac16 \int \gamma_{11d} \wedge \del \gamma_{11d} \wedge \del \gamma_{11d}$. 
Upon reduction, this becomes 
\beqn\label{eqn:jred}
\int_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} \eta \wedge \del \gamma \wedge \del \gamma .
\eeqn

The sum of the action functionals \eqref{eqn:bfred} and \eqref{eqn:jred} does not precisely agree with the IIA action $\til I_{IIA}$. 
To relate the two actions we must make the following field redefinition:
\[
\til \theta = \frac{1}{1-\nu} \theta, \quad \til \eta = (1- \nu) \eta .
\]
Notice that this change of coordinates is compatible with the odd symplectic pairing on the fields. 
Under this field redefinition the total dimensionally reduced action can be written as
\begin{multline}
\int^{\Omega_{\CC^4}}_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} \frac{1}{1-\nu} \mu^2 \vee \del \gamma + \int_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} \frac{1}{1-\nu} \til\eta \wedge \del \gamma \wedge \del \gamma \\ + \int^{\Omega_{\CC^4}}_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} (\til\theta \wedge \mu) \vee  \del \left(\frac{1}{1-\nu} \til\eta\right) .
\end{multline}
The first line agrees with the first and third terms in \eqref{eqn:IIAactionpot}. 

The second line is very close to the second term in \eqref{eqn:IIAactionpot}, but they are still not quite the same. 
They are, however, cohomologous. 
Integrating by parts and applying the BV relation, we can write the second line as
\[
\int^{\Omega_{\CC^4}}_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} \left(\frac{1}{1-\nu} \til\eta\right)\wedge \div (\til\theta \wedge \mu)  = \int^{\Omega_{\CC^4}}_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} \frac{1}{1-\nu} (\til\eta \wedge \mu) \vee \partial \til \theta + \int^{\Omega_{\CC^4}}_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} \frac{1}{1-\nu} \til \eta \wedge \div \mu \wedge \til \theta .
\]
The first term in this equation agrees precisely with the second term in \eqref{eqn:IIAactionpot}. 
The final term is cohomological trivial via the odd Lagrangian $\int^\Omega \log(1-\nu) \wedge \til \eta \wedge \til \theta$.
%
%Let $\pi : \R\times \C^{\times}\times X \to \R^{2}\times X$ be the projection with fiber $S^{1}\subset \C^{\times}$. Note that there is an isomorphism \[\int: \pi^{*}(\Omega^{\bullet}(\R^{2})\otimes \cE_{pot})\to \cE\] given by \[(\eta, \mu, \nu, \beta,\gamma,\theta)\mapsto (\nu = \nu, \mu = \mu + \theta \vee \Omega_{X} \wedge\del_{z}, \beta = \beta, \gamma = \gamma\vee \Omega_{X} \eta dz ).\] It is clear that this isomorphism presrves the BV pairings; we need only check that $\int^{*} I$ is cohomologous to $I_{pot}$ in the deformation-obstruction complex of the free limit of $\Omega^{\bu}(\R^{2})\otimes \cE_{pot}$.
%
%We readily compute:
%\[\int^{*}I = \]
\end{proof}

\subsection{The twist of type I supergravity}

We now turn to a different type of redution of the 11-dimensional theory, this time involving type I supergravity. 
In this section, we briefly recall the description of type I supergravity following \cite{CLtypeI} which was motivated by the unoriented $B$-model. 
In \cite{SWspinor}, the second two authors verified the conjectural description of the space of fields recalled below using the pure spinor formalism. 
Unlike type IIA supergravity, there only exists an $SU(5)$ invariant twist of type I supergravity and it is holomorphic in the maximal number of dimensions.

Concretely, the space of fields of the $SU(5)$ twist of type I supergravity is a subspace of minimal Kodaira--Spencer theory on $\CC^5$. 
The $\ZZ/2$ graded space of field equipped with its linear BRST operator is 
\beqn\label{eqn:IIApot}
\begin{tikzcd}
- & + & - & +  \\ \hline
{\PV^{1,\bu}}(\CC^5) \arrow[r, "u\div"]    & {u\PV^{0,\bu}}(\CC^5) \\
{\PV^{3,\bu}} (\CC^5)\arrow[r, "u\div"] & {u\PV^{2,\bu}} (\CC^5)\arrow[r, "u\div"] & {u^2\PV^{1,\bu}}(\CC^5) \arrow[r, "u\div"] & {u^3\PV^{0,\bu}}(\CC^5)
\end{tikzcd}.
\eeqn

Let us give a description of the classical action. 
Introduce notations for the fields of this type I model:
\beqn\label{eqn:Ifields}
\mu + u \nu \in \PV^{1, \bu}(\CC^5) \oplus u \PV^{0,\bu} (\CC^5), \quad \sigma \in \PV^{3,\bu}(\CC^5) .
\eeqn
We will not need an explicit notation for the remaining descendant fields. 

\begin{conj}
The twist of type I supergravity on $\CC^5$ is the $\Z/2$-graded theory with fields $\mu+u\nu, \sigma$ as above and with classical action
\beqn\label{eqn:typeIaction}
I_{{\rm type\, I}} = {\rm Tr}_{\CC^5} \frac{1}{1-\nu} \mu^2 \vee \sigma + \cdots
\eeqn
where the $\cdots$ stands for terms involving the higher descendant fields. 
%The $L_{\infty}$ structure is the natural one on the tensor product of the cdga $\Omega^{\bu}(M)$ with the $L_{\infty}$-algebra $\cE_{mKS}$.
\end{conj}

\parsec[s:typeIpot]

Like in the type IIA discussion, there is a slight modification of the type I model above which is most directly related to 11-dimensional supergravity. 

This modification involves replacing the field $\sigma$ above by a potential $\til \gamma \in \Omega^{1,\bu}(\CC^5)$ which satisfies $\Omega \vee \sigma = \del \til \gamma$. 
This condition does not fix $\til \gamma$ uniquely, there is a gauge symmetry of the form $\til \gamma \to \til \gamma + \del \til \beta$. 

In detail, this potential theory we are considering has underlying cochain complex of fields
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Ipot} 
  \begin{tikzcd}[row sep = 1 ex]
    - & + & -\\ \hline
    \PV^{1,\bu}(\CC^5)_\mu \ar[r, "\div"] & \PV^{0,\bu}(\CC^5)_\nu  \\
         & \Omega^{0,\bu}(\CC^5)_{\til\beta} \ar[r, "\del"] & \Omega^{1,\bu}(\CC^5)_{\til\gamma} .
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation} 

The type I action \eqref{eqn:typeIaction} completely determines the action of this theory with potentials. 
One simply takes the action and replaces all appearances of $\sigma$ with $\Omega^{-1} \vee \del \til\gamma$. 
This yields the interaction of the potential theory
\beqn\label{eqn:Iactionpot}
\til I_{\text{type I}} = \frac12 \int^\Omega_{\CC^5} \frac{1}{1-\nu} \mu^2 \vee \del \til\gamma .
\eeqn
Notice that the terms involving higher descendants vanishes since these fields are set to zero in the potential theory.

\subsection{Slab compactification} 

To this end, we consider placing 11-dimensional supergravity on the manifold $\CC^5 \times [0,1]$. 
In order to do this, we must choose appropriate boundary conditions at $t=0$ and $t=1$.

The phase space of the theory at $t=0$ or $t=1$ is 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:lin1} 
  \begin{tikzcd}[row sep = 1 ex]
    - & + \\ \hline
    \PV^{1,\bu}(\CC^5)_\mu \ar[r, "\div"] & \PV^{0,\bu}(\CC^5)_\nu \\ 
     \Omega^{0,\bu}(\CC^5)_\beta \ar[r, "\del"] & \Omega^{1,\bu}(\CC^5)_\gamma.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
The wedge an integrate pairing between the top and bottom lines induces an {\em even} symplectic structure on the phase space. 
Denote this phase space by $\cE_{\del}$ for the moment.

The phase space is equipped with the restriction of the linear BRST operator of the full 11-dimensional theory. 
There is also a non linear BRST operator, just like in the bulk theory.
The BV action induces a $L_\infty$ structure on the parity shift $\Pi\cE_{\del}$ whose cohomology is still a trivial central extension of $E(5,10)$. 

A boundary condition is given by a Lagrangian subspace of $\cE_{\del}$ with respect to this even symplectic structure. 
To make sense of the theory on $\CC^5 \times [0,1]$ we must make the choice of two separate boundary conditions 
\[
\cM_{t=0} , \cM_{t=1} \subset \cE_{\del} .
\]
Moreover, these boundary conditions carry non linear BRST endowing their parity shifts $\Pi \cM_{t=0} , \Pi\cM_{t=1}$ with the structures of $L_\infty$ algebras. 
These $L_\infty$ structures must be compatible with the one on the phase space.
In fact, in our context these boundary conditions are abstractly isomorphic. 
We will explain the explicit boundary conditions momentarily. 

In \cite{?} an explicit model has been given for the theory compactified along the slab for theories which are topological in the direction normal to the boundary.
The fields of the theory compactified on the slab is computed by the {\em derived} intersection of the two Lagrangians:
\[
\cM_{t=0} \overset{\LL}{\underset{\cE_{\del}}{\times}}\cM_{t=1}.
\]

\parsec[s:boundary]
At $t=0$, the boundary condition of the 11-dimensional theory is determined by declaring 
\[
\cM_{t=0}: \quad \gamma|_{t=0} = \beta|_{t=0} = 0 .
\]
To place the theory on $\CC^5 \times [0,1]$ we take the same boundary condition at $t=1$:
\[
\cM_{t=1}: \quad \gamma|_{t=1} = \beta|_{t=1} = 0 .
\]

\begin{prop}
With these boundary conditions of the classical 11-dimensional theory on $\CC^5 \times [0,1]$, the compactification along 
\[
\CC^5 \times [0,1] \to \CC^5
\]
is equivalent to the twist of type I supergravity on $\CC^5$. 
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Notice that both $\cM_{t=0}$ and $\cM_{t=0}$ are abstractly isomorphic to the complex resolving divergence-free vector fields
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:lin2} 
  \begin{tikzcd}[row sep = 1 ex]
    - & + \\ \hline
    \PV^{1,\bu}(\CC^5)_\mu \ar[r, "\div"] & \PV^{0,\bu}(\CC^5)_\nu  .
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}

To compute the derived intersection between the two Lagrangians at $t=0$ and $t=1$ we replace the Lagrangian morphism $\cM_{t=0} \hookrightarrow \cE_{\del}$. 
Consider the cochain complex $\til \cM_{t=0}$ defined by
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:lin3} 
  \begin{tikzcd}[row sep = 1 ex]
    - & + & - \\ \hline
    \PV^{1,\bu}(\CC^5)_\mu \ar[r, "\div"] & \PV^{0,\bu}(\CC^5)_\nu \\ 
     \Omega^{0,\bu}(\CC^5)_\beta \ar[dr,dotted,"\id"]\ar[r, "\del"] & \Omega^{1,\bu}(\CC^5)_\gamma \ar[dr,dotted,"\id"] \\
     & \Omega^{0,\bu}(\CC^5)_{\til\beta} \ar[r, "\del"] & \Omega^{1,\bu}(\CC^5)_{\til\gamma} .
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
Notice that as a graded vector space, this complex is of the form $\cE_{\del} \oplus (\Omega^{0,\bu} \oplus \Pi \Omega^{1,\bu})$. 
The $L_\infty$ structure on $\Pi \til \cM_{t=0}$ extends the one on $\cE_{\del}$ coming from the bulk BV action. 
Notice that the obvious embedding $\cM_{t=0} \hookrightarrow \til \cM_{t=0}$ is a quasi-isomorphism.

The projection map $\til \cM_{t=0} \twoheadrightarrow \cE_{\del}$ factors the original Lagrangian inclusion as
\[
\cM_{t=0} \hookrightarrow \til \cM_{t=0} \twoheadrightarrow \cE_{\del} .
\]
To compute the derived intersection of $\cM_{t=0}$ and $\cM_{t=1}$ we can compute the ordinary intersection of $\til \cM_{t=0}$ and $\cM_{t=1}$. 

Let $\mu_{t=1}$ and $\nu_{t=1}$ denote the fields present in the other boundary condition $\cM_{t=1}$. 
The intersection $\til \cM_{t=0} \times_{\cE_{\del}} \cM_{t=1}$ is computed by setting the fields $\beta, \gamma$ to zero and $\mu=\mu_{t=1}$, $\nu = \nu_{t=1}$. 
Thus, we are left with
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:lin3} 
  \begin{tikzcd}[row sep = 1 ex]
    - & + & -\\ \hline
    \PV^{1,\bu}(\CC^5)_\mu \ar[r, "\div"] & \PV^{0,\bu}(\CC^5)_\nu  \\
         & \Omega^{0,\bu}(\CC^5)_{\til\beta} \ar[r, "\del"] & \Omega^{1,\bu}(\CC^5)_{\til\gamma} 
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
This is precisely the underlying cochain complex of fields for the type I model with potentials. 
\end{proof}

\subsection{Compactification along a CY3} 

In the first section we saw that the 11-dimensional theory can be defined on any manifold that is a product of a Calabi--Yau five-fold with a smooth oriented one-manifold. 
In this section, we investigate an important compactification of the 11-dimensional theory which involves the Calabi--Yau manifold $X \times \CC^2$ where $X$ is a simply connected compact Calabi--Yau three-fold.

The compactification of the theory along the three-fold $X$ 
\[
X \times \CC^2 \times \RR \to \CC^2 \times \RR
\]
yields an effective five-dimensional theory which is holomorphic along $\CC^2$ and topological along $\RR$. 
Upon compactification, we will find a match with a description of the twist of five-dimensional minimally supersymmetric supergravity. 

\begin{prop}
\label{prop:5dsugra}
The compactification of the 11-dimensional theory along a Calabi--Yau three-fold $X$ is equivalent to the twist of 5d $\cN=1$ supergravity with $h^{1,1}(X)-1$ vector multiplets and $h^{1,2}(X) + 1$ hyper multiplets. 
\end{prop}

\parsec[s:5dsugra]

We give a conjectural capitulation of the twist of 5d $\cN=1$ supergravity. 
Before twisting, a general 5d $\cN=1$ supergravity contains a gravity multiplet coupled to some number of vector and hyper multiplets. 
The twist of the vector and hyper multiplet has been computed in \cite{ESW}, and we recall it below. 
The twist of the gravity multiplet is less clear. 
A thorough computation of the twist has yet to appear, though some checks have been established by Elliott and the last author in \cite{EWpois}. 
We give a description of the twist now, but leave a detailed computation from first principles to future work. 

The gravity multiplet, see \cite{CCDF} for instance, consists of a graviton $e$, a gravitino $\psi$, and a one-form gauge field $\cA_{grav}$.
After twisting, the graviton and components of gravitino decompose into two Dolbeault-de Rham valued fields 
\[
\alpha, \eta \in \Pi \Omega^{0,\bu}(\CC^2) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR) ,
\]
whose lowest components both carry odd parity. 
The one-form gauge field $\cA_{grav}$ and the remaining components of the gravitino decompose into two more Dolbeault-de Rham valued fields
\[
A_{grav} , B_{grav} \in \Pi \Omega^{0,\bu}(\CC^2) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR) ,
\]
whose lowest components also both carry odd parity. 

\begin{conj}
\label{conj:5dsugra}
The twist of 5d supergravity with vector multiplets valued in a Lie algebra $\fg$ and hypermultiplets valued in a representations $V$ has BV fields
\begin{itemize}
\item $\alpha, A_{grav} \in \Pi \Omega^{0,\bu}(\CC^2) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR)$ with conjugate fields $\eta, B_{grav}$,
\item $A \in \Pi \Omega^{0,\bu}(\CC^2) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR) \otimes \fg$ with conjugate field $B$,
\item $\chi \in \Omega^{0,\bu}(\CC^2) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR) \otimes V$ with conjugate field $\psi$.
\end{itemize}

The action is
\begin{multline}
\label{eqn:5daction} 
\int^\Omega_{\CC^2 \times \RR} \left(\eta \dbar \alpha + B_{grav} \dbar A_{grav} + B \dbar A + \psi \dbar \chi \right) \\
  \int^\Omega_{\CC^2 \times \RR} \left( \frac12\eta \{\alpha, \alpha\} +  B_{grav} \{\alpha, A_{grav}\}+ B \{\alpha, A\} +  \psi \{\alpha, \chi \}\right) \\ 
+ \frac16 \int_{\CC^2 \times \RR} B_{grav} \del B_{grav} \del B_{grav} .
\end{multline}
\end{conj}

\brian{general background on susy. Why expect 5d $\cN=1$ susy}

\parsec[-]

With this description of the twist of five-dimensional supergravity, we turn to the proof of Proposition \ref{prop:5dsugra}. 

First, we set up some notation. 
Let $\Omega_X$ be the holomorphic volume form on $X$. 
To define the $11$-dimensional theory on $X \times \CC^2 \times \RR$ we use the Calabi--Yau form $\Omega_X \wedge \d z_1 \wedge \d z_2$, where $\{z_i\}$ is a holomorphic coordinate on $\CC^2$. 
Let $\omega \in \Omega^{1,1}(X)$ be a fixed K\"ahler form on $X$.
For any $k$, let $H^k(X, \Omega^k_X)_\perp$ denote the cohomology of the primitive elements. 
\brian{good notation?}

Consider the 11-dimensional field $\nu_{11d}$. 
Under the equivalence
\begin{align*}
\PV^{0,\bu}(X \times \CC^2) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR) & \simeq H^{\bu}(X, \cO) \otimes \PV^{0,\bu}(\CC^2) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR) \\ & = \PV^{0,\bu}(\CC^2) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR) \oplus \Pi \Bar{\Omega}_X \PV^{0,\bu}(\CC^2) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR) 
\end{align*}
the $\nu_{11d}$ field decomposes as 
\[ 
\nu_{11d} = \nu + \Bar{\Omega}_X \til \nu .
\]
Here $\Bar{\Omega}_X$ is the complex conjugate to the holomorphic volume form on $X$. 
Notice that the zero form component of $\til \nu$ is a field with even parity. 

Next, consider the 11-dimensional field $\mu_{11d}$. 
Under the equivalence 
\begin{align*}
\Pi \PV^{1,\bu}(X \times \CC^2) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR) & \simeq \Pi H^{\bu}(X, \cO) \otimes \PV^{1,\bu}(\CC^2) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR) \\ & \oplus \Pi H^\bu(X, \T_X) \otimes \PV^{0,\bu}(X) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR) \\ & = \Pi \PV^{1,\bu}(\CC^2) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR) \oplus \Bar{\Omega}_X \PV^{1,\bu}(\CC^2) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR) \\ & \oplus H^{1}(X, \T_X) \otimes \PV^{0,\bu}(X) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR) \oplus \Pi H^{2}(X, \T_X) \otimes \PV^{0,\bu}(X) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR)
\end{align*}
the field $\mu_{11d}$ decomposes as 
\begin{align*}
\mu_{11d} & = \mu + \Bar{\Omega}_X \til \mu \\ 
& + e^i \chi_i + f^a A_a +  (\Omega_X^{-1} \vee \omega^2)A_{grav} .  
\end{align*} 
Here, $\{e^i\}_{i=1,\ldots, h^{2,1}}$ is a basis for $H^{1}(X, \T_X)$ and $\{f^a\}_{a=1,\ldots, h^{1,1}-1}$ is a basis for 
\[
H^2 (X, \Omega^2_X)_\perp \subset H^2(X, \Omega^2_X) \cong H^2(X, \T_X) . 
\]
Notice that the zero form part of $\til{\mu}$ is an even field, the zero form part of $\chi_i$ is an even field, the zero form part of $A_a$ is an odd field, and the zero form part of $\mu_\omega$ is an odd field. 

The decomposition for the 11d fields $\gamma_{11d}$ and $\beta_{11d}$ is similar. 
We record it here:
\begin{align*}
\beta_{11d} & = \beta + \Bar{\Omega}_X \til \beta \\ 
\gamma_{11d} & = \gamma + \Bar{\Omega}_X \til \gamma + e_i \psi^i + f_a B^a + \omega \wedge B_{grav}  . 
\end{align*}
Here, $\{e_i\}_{i=1,\ldots,h^{2,1}}$ is a basis for $H^2 (X, \Omega^1_X)$ dual to the basis $\{e^i\}$ under the Serre pairing.
Also, $\{f_a\}_{a=1,\ldots,h^{1,1}-1}$ is a basis for $H^{1}(X, \Omega^1_X)_\perp$ dual to the basis $\{f^a\}$. 

To compare most directly to the description of the twist of 5d $\cN=1$ supergravity we modestly modify the fields. 
Let $\del$ be the holomorphic de Rham differential along $\CC^2$. 
First, we introduce a potential for the fields $\mu$ and $\til \mu$. 
Let 
\[
\alpha, \chi \in \Omega^{0,\bu}(\CC^2) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR)
\]
be differential forms satisfying $\del \alpha = \mu \vee \Omega_{\CC^2}$ and $\del \chi = \til \mu \vee \Omega_{\CC^2}$. 
The fields $\nu, \til \nu$ are set to zero. 
Dually, we replace the fields $\gamma, \til \gamma$ their `field strengths', suitably renormalized with respect to the volume form
\[
\eta = (\d^2 z)^{-1} \vee \del \til \gamma , \quad \psi = (\d^2 z)^{-1} \vee \del \gamma \in \Omega^{0,\bu}(\CC^2) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR) .
\]
The roles of $\beta, \til \beta$ were as gauge symmetries implementing $\gamma \to \gamma + \del \beta$ and $\til \gamma \to \til \gamma + \del \til \beta$. 
Since we are replacing $\gamma, \til \gamma$ by their images under the operator $\del$, these gauge symmetries are set to zero. 

In summary, we are left with the following fields 
\[
\begin{array}{cccccccccc}
\alpha,A_{grav} & \in & \Pi \Omega^{0,\bu}(\CC^2) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR), & \eta, B_{grav} & \in & \Pi \Omega^{0,\bu}(\CC^2) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR) \\
\chi, \chi_i & \in & \Omega^{0,\bu}(\CC^2) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR),  & \psi, \psi^i & \in & \Omega^{0,\bu}(\CC^2) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR), & i=1,\ldots, h^{2,1}  \\
A_a & \in & \Pi \Omega^{0,\bu}(\CC^2) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR), & B^a & \in & \Pi \Omega^{0,\bu}(\CC^2) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR) , & a = 1, \ldots, h^{1,1}-1.
\end{array}
\]

Let us plug these fields in to the 11-dimensional action.
First, consider the BF term $\frac12 \int^{\Omega} \frac{1}{1-\nu_{11d}} \mu_{11d}^2 \gamma_{11d}$. 
With the field redefinitions above, this decomposes as
\begin{multline}\label{eqn:5dsugra1}
 \int_{\CC^2 \times \RR}^\Omega \left( \frac12 \del \alpha \wedge \del \alpha \wedge \eta + \del A_{grav} \wedge \del A_{grav} \wedge B_{grav} \right) \\
 + \int_{\CC^2 \times \RR}^\Omega \left( \del \alpha \wedge \del \chi \wedge \psi + \del \alpha \wedge \del \chi_i \wedge \psi^i + \del \alpha \wedge \del A_a \wedge B^a \right) .
\end{multline}
This term agrees with the second line in the 5d action \eqref{eqn:5daction}. 

Finally, consider the term in the 11-dimensional action $J(\gamma_{11d}) = \frac16 \int \gamma_{11d} \wedge \del \gamma_{11d} \wedge \del \gamma_{11d}$. 
This induces the five-dimensional Chern--Simons term 
\beqn\label{eqn:5dsugra2}
\frac16 \int_{\CC^2 \times \RR} B_{grav} \del B_{grav} \del B_{grav} .
\eeqn
This completes the proof. 

\subsection{The $SU(5)$ twist of type IIA supergravity}
