\section{Dimensional reduction and 10-dimensional supergravity}

In this section we demonstrate that our proposal for the action of minimally twisted 11-dimensional supergravity agrees with conjectural descriptions of twisted type IIA and type I supergravities due to Costello and Li. 

The original motivation for $M$-theory was as the strong coupling limit for type IIA string theory.
Roughly, the radius of the $M$-theory circle plays the role of this coupling constant. 
Additionally, at low energies $M$-theory is expected to be approximated by 11-dimensional supergravity in the same way that the low energy limit of type IIA/IIB string theory is type IIA/IIB supergravity. 
Combining these two pictures, various checks have been made that the dimensional reduction of 11-dimensional supergravity along the $M$-theory circle is type IIA supergravity. 

Motivated by the topological string, Costello and Li have laid out a series of conjectures for twists of type IIA/IIB supergravity \cite{CLsugra} and type I supergravity \cite{CLtypeI}. 
Their description was inspired by the model of the open and closed $B$-model topological string on a Calabi--Yau manifold. 
The open sector is holomorphic Chern--Simons theory \cite{WittenOpen} and the closed sector is called Kodaira--Spencer theory \cite{BCOV}. 
There are a few different versions of Kodaira--Spencer theory, but the shared characteristic is that they are all `gravitational' in nature; they describe fluctuations of the Calabi--Yau structure. 
From this point of view, Kodaira--Spencer theory is at the heart of the formulation of the various flavors of twisted 10-dimensional supergravity.

We begin by introducing certain variants of Kodaira--Spencer theory which will feature in the descriptions of twists of type IIA and type I supergravity.

\subsection{Kodaira--Spencer theory}

Let $X$ be a Calabi--Yau manifold; for now it can be of arbitrary complex dimension. 
Define
\deq{
  \PV^{i,j}(X) = \Omega^{0,j}(X, \wedge^i \T_X).
}
We will consider the graded space $\PV^{\bu,\bu}(X) = \oplus_{i,j} \PV^{i,j}(X)[-i-j]$ where the piece of type $(i,j)$ sits in degree $i+j$. 

For each fixed $i$, while we let $j$ vary, the $\dbar$ operator defines a cochain complex $\PV^{i,\bu}(X) = (\oplus_j\PV^{i,j}(X) [-j], \dbar)$ which provides a resolution for the sheaf of holomorphic polyvector fields of type $i$. 
The divergence operator extends to an operator of the form
\[
\div \colon \PV^{i,\bu}(X) \to \PV^{i-1,\bu}(X) .
\]

Motivated by the states of the topological $B$-model, one defines the fields of Kodaira--Spencer gravity on $X$ to be the cochain complex
\beqn\label{eqn:ks1}
\left(\PV^{\bu,\bu} (X)[[u]] [2] \, , \, \dbar + u \div\right) .
\eeqn 
Here, $u$ is a parameter of cohomological degree $+2$, which turns $\delta_{KS}^{(1)} = \dbar + u \div$ into an operator of homogenous degree $+1$. 
We also have performed an overall cohomological shift by $2$ so that $u^k \PV^{i,j}$ sits in degree $i+j+2k-2$. 
More precisely, this is a model for the $S^1$-equivariant cohomology of the states of the $B$-model on a closed disk. 
We refer to \cite{CLtypeI, CLsugra} for detailed justification for this ansatz.

\subsection{The $SU(4)$ twist of type IIA supergravity}

\parsec[sec:SU(4)twist]

Let $X$ be a Calabi-Yau manifold of complex dimension four. 
The complex of fields of minimal Kodaira--Spencer theory on $X$ takes the form
\beqn
\begin{tikzcd}
                        &                          &                                     & {\PV^{0,\bu}}    \\
                        &                          & {\PV^{1,\bu}} \arrow[r, "u\div"]    & {u\PV^{0,\bu}}   \\
                        & {\PV^{2,\bu}} \arrow[r, "u\div"]  & {u\PV^{1,\bu}} \arrow[r, "u\div"]   & {u^2\PV^{0,\bu}} \\
{\PV^{3,\bu}} \arrow[r, "u\div"] & {u\PV^{2,\bu}} \arrow[r, "u\div"] & {u^2\PV^{1,\bu}} \arrow[r, "u\div"] & {u^3\PV^{0,\bu}}
\end{tikzcd}.
\eeqn
Denote this complex by $\cE_{mKS}(X)$. 
The classical BCOV action $I_{BCOV}$ follows from the general formula we gave above. 

\brian{I've commented this out below, since we should just introduce minimal BCOV in general up above}

%Clearly, the inclusion is a Poisson map, so restricting $I_{BCOV}$ to this subcomplex defines another $\Z/2$ graded Poisson BV theory referred to as minimal Kodaira-Spencer theory. Under the identification of Kodaira-Spencer theory as the closed string sector of the B-model, minimal Kodaira-Spencer theory should be thought of as consisting of those closed string fields present in the supergravity approximation.

With this in hand the conjecture of \cite{CLSugra} takes the following form.

\begin{conj}
The $SU(4)$-invariant twist of type IIA supergravity on $\RR^2\times \CC^4$ is the $\Z/2$-graded Poisson BV theory with fields \[
\alpha = \sum_n \alpha_n u^n \in \cE_{mKS}(\CC^4) \otimes \Omega^{\bu}(\RR^2).\] 
The classical interaction takes the form $I_{IIA} = \int_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} \alpha_0^3 + {\rm higher\;order\;terms}.$
%The $L_{\infty}$ structure is the natural one on the tensor product of the cdga $\Omega^{\bu}(M)$ with the $L_{\infty}$-algebra $\cE_{mKS}$.
\end{conj}

We will need a more detailed description of the classical action. 
For the moment, let us introduce some notations for the fields of this IIA model, as always we leave the internal Dolbeault degree implicit:
\begin{multline}
\eta \in \PV^{0,\bu}(\CC^4) \otimes \Omega^\bu (\RR^2), \quad \mu + u \nu \in \PV^{1, \bu}(\CC^4) \otimes \Omega^\bu (\RR^2) \oplus u \PV^{0,\bu} (\CC^4) \otimes \Omega^\bu (\RR^2) \\
\Pi \in \PV^{3,\bu}(\CC^4) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR^2), \quad \sigma \in \PV^{3,\bu}(\CC^4) \otimes \Omega^\bu (\RR^2) .
\end{multline}
We will not need an explicit notation for the remaining descendant fields. 

With this notation in hand, we have the more precise form of the action appearing in the conjecture:
\beqn\label{eqn:IIAaction}
I_{IIA} = \frac12 {\rm Tr}_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} \frac{1}{1-\nu} \mu^2 \wedge \Pi + {\rm Tr}_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} \frac{1}{1-\nu} \eta \wedge \mu \wedge \sigma + \frac12 {\rm Tr}_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} \frac{1}{1-\nu} \eta \wedge \Pi^2 + \cdots 
\eeqn
where the $\cdots$ denote terms involving higher order descendants. 

\parsec[sec:IIApot]

Our goal is to compare the dimensional reduction of our 11-dimensional theory on $\CC^5 \times \RR$
%where $X$ is a Calabi-Yau 4-fold 
with the $SU(4)$ invariant twist of type IIA on $\R^{2}\times \CC^4$. 
Doing so will require some additional modifications to the above conjectural description. 

Recall that in the physical theory, the components of the $C$-field in 11d that are not supported along the M-theory circle become the components of the Ramond--Ramond 2-form of type IIA. However, as noted in \cite{CLSugra} components of Ramond--Ramond fields do not appear as fields in Kodaira--Spencer theory; rather it is components of their field strengths that appear. Since components of the $C$-field become components of $\gamma$ in $\cE$ \surya{hopefully we can see this in the component fields section}, this suggests that we must modify our description of the twist of type IIA to include potentials for certain fields.

Explicitly, to define this theory we introduce a potential for both the $\Pi$ and $\sigma$ fields. 
First, we introduce a field $\gamma \in \Omega^{1,\bu}(\CC^4) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR^2)$ (not to be confused, yet, with the $\gamma$ field in our 11-dimensional theory) which satisfies $\Pi \vee \Omega = \del \gamma$ where $\Omega$ is the Calabi--Yau form on $\CC^4$. 
This condition does not uniquely fix $\gamma$. 
There is a new linear gauge symmetry determined by $\gamma \to \gamma + \div \beta$ where $\beta$ is a ghost that we must also introduce. 
Similarly, we introduce a field $\theta \in \Omega^{0,\bu}(\CC^4) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR^2)$ which satisfies $\sigma \vee \Omega = \del \theta$, there is no extra gauge symmetry present in this condition.\footnote{Using the Calabi--Yau form we have normalized the potential fields $\gamma, \beta,\theta$ to be written as differential forms instead of polyvector fields.}

In diagrammatic detail, the potential theory we are considering has underlying cochain complex of fields
\beqn\label{eqn:IIApot}
\begin{tikzcd}
- & + \\ \hline
& {\PV^{0,\bu} (\CC^4) \otimes \Omega^\bu (\RR^2) }_\eta  \\
{\PV^{1,\bu} (\CC^4) \otimes \Omega^\bu (\RR^2)}_\mu \arrow[r, "u\div"] & u{\PV^{0,\bu} (\CC^4) \otimes \Omega^\bu (\RR^2)}_\nu \\
u^{-1}{\Omega^{0,\bu} (\CC^4) \otimes \Omega^\bu (\RR^2)}_\beta \arrow[r, "u\div"] & {\Omega^{1,\bu} (\CC^4) \otimes \Omega^\bu (\RR^2)}_\gamma  \\
{\Omega^{0,\bu} (\CC^4) \otimes \Omega^\bu (\RR^2)}_\theta &
\end{tikzcd}
\eeqn.

Recall that the original fields of the IIA supergravity model on $\CC^4 \times \RR^2$ was equipped with an odd Poisson bivector which was degenerate.
In other words, it did not define a theory in the conventional BV formalism. 
One of the key features of this new complex of fields, after we have taken these potentials, is that it is equipped with an odd non-degenerate pairing thus equipping it with the structure of a theory in the conventional BV formalism. 

The pairing is $\Res_u \frac{\d u}{u} \int^\Omega_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} \alpha \vee \alpha'$ where $\alpha, \alpha'$ are two general fields in this potential theory on $\CC^4 \times \RR^2$. 
Explicitly, in the description of the fields in \eqref{eqn:IIApot} the pairing is 
\[
\int^\Omega_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} \eta \theta + \int^\Omega_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} \mu \vee \gamma + \int^\Omega_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} \nu \beta .
\]
This pairing is compatible with the odd Poisson bracket present in the original theory on $\CC^4 \times \RR^2$. \brian{finish}

The type IIA action completely determines the action of this theory with potentials. 
One simply takes the \eqref{eqn:IIAaction} and replaces all appearances of $\Pi$ with $\div \gamma$ and all appearances of $\sigma$ with $\div \theta$. 
This yields the interaction of the potential theory
\beqn\label{eqn:IIAactionpot}
\til I_{IIA} = \frac12 \int^\Omega_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} \frac{1}{1-\nu} \mu^2 \vee \del \gamma + \int^\Omega_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} \frac{1}{1-\nu} (\eta \wedge \mu) \vee \del \theta + \frac12 \int_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} \frac{1}{1-\nu} \eta \wedge \del \gamma \wedge \del \gamma 
\eeqn
Notice that the terms involving higher descendants vanishes since these fields are set to zero in the potential theory.

%Note that there is a natural map of cochain complexes $\partial \cE_{pot}\to \cE_{mKS}$ given by the dotted arrows below:
%\beqn
%\begin{tikzcd}
%                                       & {\PV^{0,\bu}} \arrow[rrr, dotted, "\id"] &                          &                                     & {\PV^{0,\bu}}    \\
%{\PV^{1,\bu}} \arrow[r, "u\div"]       & {u\PV^{0,\bu}} \arrow[rr, dotted, "\id"] &                          & {\PV^{1,\bu}} \arrow[r, "u\div"]    & {u\PV^{0,\bu}}   \\
%{u^{-1}\PV^{4,\bu}} \arrow[r, "u\div"] & {\PV^{3,\bu}} \arrow[r, dotted, "\div"]  & {\PV^{2,\bu}} \arrow[r]  & {u\PV^{1,\bu}} \arrow[r, "u\div"]   & {u^2\PV^{0,\bu}} \\
%{\PV^{4,\bu}} \arrow[r, dotted, "\div"]        & {\PV^{3,\bu}} \arrow[r]          & {u\PV^{2,\bu}} \arrow[r] & {u^2\PV^{1,\bu}} \arrow[r, "u\div"] & {u^3\PV^{0,\bu}}
%\end{tikzcd}.
%\eeqn
%This is easily seen to be a Poisson map. We have that $I_{pot} = \partial^{*}I_{BCOV}$, so we see that $I_{pot}$ satisfies the classical master equation. Therefore, $I_{pot}$ determines an $L_{\infty}$ structure on $\cE_{pot}$, and hence one on $\Omega^{\bu}(\R^{2})\otimes \cE_{pot}$. In what follows, the $SU(4)$-invariant twist of IIA will refer to the BV theory $\Omega^{\bu}(\R^{2})\otimes \cE_{pot}$.

\parsec[sec:dimred]

We turn to the proof of the main result of this section that the dimensional reduction of our 11-dimensional theory agrees with the twist of IIA supergravity just introduced. 

We recall the notion of dimensional along a holomorphic direction following \cite{ESW}. 
Suppose that $V_\RR$ is a real vector space and denote by $V$ its complexification. 
We consider a field theory defined on $M \times V$, which is holomorphic along $V$ (in particular, this means that the theory is translation invariant along $V$).  
We consider the dimensional reduction along the projection 
\beqn\label{eqn:dimred}
M \times V \to M \times V_\RR
\eeqn
induced by ${\rm Re} \colon V \to V_\RR$.
Most relevant for us is the case when $V = \CC$ and $M$ is $\CC^4 \times \RR$, but the explicit form of the theory along $M$ is not important at the moment.

In fact, we might as well assume that $M$ is a point and that the space of fields is of the form $\Omega^{0,\bu}(V) \otimes W$ for $W$ some graded vector space. 
As properly formulated in \cite{ESW}, it is shown that the dimensional reduction along $V \to V_\RR$ is equivalent to the theory whose fields are $\Omega^\bu(V_\RR) \otimes W$. 
In other words, the dimensional reduction of the holomorphic theory on $V$ is a topological theory on $V_\RR$. 

If we put $M$ back in, the result is similar. 
Suppose the original theory is of the form $\cE(M) \otimes \Omega^{0,\bu}(V) \otimes W$.
Then, the dimensional reduction along \eqref{eqn:dimred} is the theory whose space of fields is $\cE(M) \otimes \Omega^\bu(V_\RR) \otimes W$.

An explicit model for this reduction can be described as follows. 
Suppose $V \cong \CC^n$ and place the theory on $(\CC^\times)^{\times n} \subset \CC^n$. 
The dimensional reduction along $\CC^n \to \RR^n$ agrees with the compactification of the theory along $S^1 \times \cdots \times S^1$ where one throws away all nonzero winding modes around each circle.

\begin{prop}\label{prop:dimred}
The $SU(4)$ invariant twist of type IIA on $\CC^4 \times \RR^2$ is equivalent to the dimensional reduction of the 11-dimensional along  
\[
\CC^4 \times \CC \times \RR_t \to \CC^4 \times \RR_x \times \RR_t \cong \CC^4 \times \RR^2 .
\]
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Let us denote the holomorphic coordinate we are reducing along by $z_5 = x + \im y$. 
We first read off the dimensional reduction of each component field of the 11-dimensional theory. 
Per the above discussion, this is obtained by taking all fields to be independent of $y$ and replacing $\d \zbar_5$ by $\d x$. 
To not confuse the notations of fields in 10 and 11 dimensions, we use the notation $\alpha_{11d}$ to denote an 11-dimensional field.

The reductions of the 11d fields $\nu_{11d}, \beta_{11d}$ are easy to describe. 
Recall that 
\[
\nu_{11d} \in \PV^{0,\bu}(\CC^5) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR) .
\]
The reduction of this field is a 10d $\nu$ field
\[
\nu (z_i,x,t) = \nu_{11d} (z_i, x, y=0, t) |_{\d \zbar_5 = \d x}  .
\]
Similarly, the reduction of $\beta_{11d}$ is a 10d $\beta$ field
\[
\beta (z_i,x,t) = \beta_{11d} (z_i, x, y=0, t) |_{\d \zbar_5 = \d x}  .
\]

The reduction of the 11d fields $\mu_{11d}$ and $\gamma_{11d}$ require a bit of massaging. 
We break the $SU(5)$ symmetry to $SU(4)$ to write
\[
\mu_{11d} = \mu^0_{11d} + \theta_{11d} \partial_{z_5} 
\]
where
\begin{align*}
\mu^0_{11d} & \in \PV^{1,\bu}(\CC^4) \otimes \Omega^{0,\bu}(\CC_{z_5}) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR_t) \\
\theta_{11d} & \in \Omega^{0,\bu}(\CC^4) \otimes \Omega^{0,\bu}(\CC_{z_5}) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR_t) .
\end{align*}
The dimensional reduction of $\mu^0_{11d}$ is a 10d $\mu$ field
\[
\mu(z_i,x,t) = \mu_{11d}^0 (z_i, x,y=0,t)|_{\d \zbar_5 = \d x} .
\]
The dimensional reduction of $\theta_{11d}$ is a $\theta$ field
\[
\theta(z_i,x,t) = \theta_{11d} (z_i, x,y=0,t)|_{\d \zbar_5 = \d x} .
\]

Finally, write the 11d field $\gamma_{11d}$ as
\[
\gamma_{11d} = \gamma_{11d}^0 + \eta_{11d} \d z_5
\]
where
\begin{align*}
\gamma^0_{11d} & \in \Omega^{1,\bu}(\CC^4) \otimes \Omega^{0,\bu}(\CC_{z_5}) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR_t) \\
\eta_{11d} & \in \PV^{0,\bu}(\CC^4) \otimes \Omega^{0,\bu}(\CC_{z_5}) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR_t) .
\end{align*}
The dimensional reduction of $\gamma^0_{11d}$ is a 10d $\gamma$ field
\[
\gamma(z_i,x,t) = \gamma_{11d}^0 (z_i, x,y=0,t)|_{\d \zbar_5 = \d x} .
\]
The dimensional reduction of $\eta_{11d}$ is an $\eta$ field
\[
\eta(z_i,x,t) = \eta_{11d} (z_i, x,y=0,t)|_{\d \zbar_5 = \d x} .
\]

Next, we read off the dimensional reduction of the 11d action. 
Let us first focus on the term present in BF theory which is
$\int^\Omega \frac{1}{1-\nu_{11d}} \mu_{11d}^2 \vee \del \gamma_{11d}$.
Upon reduction, this becomes 
\beqn\label{eqn:bfred}
\int^{\Omega_{\CC^4}}_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} \frac{1}{1-\nu} \mu^2 \vee \del \gamma + \int^{\Omega_{\CC^4}}_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} \frac{1}{1-\nu} (\theta \wedge \mu) \vee  \del \eta 
\eeqn

Next, consider the cubic term in the 11d action $J = \frac16 \int \gamma_{11d} \wedge \del \gamma_{11d} \wedge \del \gamma_{11d}$. 
Upon reduction, this becomes 
\beqn\label{eqn:jred}
\int_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} \eta \wedge \del \gamma \wedge \del \gamma .
\eeqn

The sum of the action functionals \eqref{eqn:bfred} and \eqref{eqn:jred} does not precisely agree with the IIA action $\til I_{IIA}$. 
To relate the two actions we must make the following field redefinition:
\[
\til \theta = \frac{1}{1-\nu} \theta, \quad \til \eta = (1- \nu) \eta .
\]
Notice that this change of coordinates is compatible with the odd symplectic pairing on the fields. 
Under this field redefinition the total dimensionally reduced action can be written as
\begin{multline}
\int^{\Omega_{\CC^4}}_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} \frac{1}{1-\nu} \mu^2 \vee \del \gamma + \int_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} \frac{1}{1-\nu} \til\eta \wedge \del \gamma \wedge \del \gamma \\ + \int^{\Omega_{\CC^4}}_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} (\til\theta \wedge \mu) \vee  \del \left(\frac{1}{1-\nu} \til\eta\right) .
\end{multline}
The first line agrees with the first and third terms in \eqref{eqn:IIAactionpot}. 

The second line is very close to the second term in \eqref{eqn:IIAactionpot}, but they are still not quite the same. 
They are, however, cohomologous. 
Integrating by parts and applying the BV relation, we can write the second line as
\[
\int^{\Omega_{\CC^4}}_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} \left(\frac{1}{1-\nu} \til\eta\right)\wedge \div (\til\theta \wedge \mu)  = \int^{\Omega_{\CC^4}}_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} \frac{1}{1-\nu} (\til\eta \wedge \mu) \vee \partial \til \theta + \int^{\Omega_{\CC^4}}_{\CC^4 \times \RR^2} \frac{1}{1-\nu} \til \eta \wedge \div \mu \wedge \til \theta .
\]
The first term in this equation agrees precisely with the second term in \eqref{eqn:IIAactionpot}. 
The final term is cohomological trivial via the odd Lagrangian $\int^\Omega \log(1-\nu) \wedge \til \eta \wedge \til \theta$.
%
%Let $\pi : \R\times \C^{\times}\times X \to \R^{2}\times X$ be the projection with fiber $S^{1}\subset \C^{\times}$. Note that there is an isomorphism \[\int: \pi^{*}(\Omega^{\bullet}(\R^{2})\otimes \cE_{pot})\to \cE\] given by \[(\eta, \mu, \nu, \beta,\gamma,\theta)\mapsto (\nu = \nu, \mu = \mu + \theta \vee \Omega_{X} \wedge\del_{z}, \beta = \beta, \gamma = \gamma\vee \Omega_{X} \eta dz ).\] It is clear that this isomorphism presrves the BV pairings; we need only check that $\int^{*} I$ is cohomologous to $I_{pot}$ in the deformation-obstruction complex of the free limit of $\Omega^{\bu}(\R^{2})\otimes \cE_{pot}$.
%
%We readily compute:
%\[\int^{*}I = \]
\end{proof}
