\section{Residual supersymmetry} 
\label{sec:susy}
%m2brane

In this section we consider the minimal twist of 11-dimensinoal supersymmetry explicitly. 
We compute the residual supersymmetry algebra given by taking the cohomology of the 11-dimensional supersymmetry algebra with respect to the minimal twisting supercharge. 
In order for this to be a symmetry of the 11-dimensional theory it is necessary to perform a central extension of the 11-dimensional supersymmetry algebra by the $M2$ brane.
We will see how this central extension is compatible, upon twisting by the minimal supercharge, with the central extension of $E(5,10)$ we found as the global symmetry algebra in the previous section. 

\subsection{Supersymmetry in 11 dimensions}
\label{sec:11dsusy}

The (complexified) eleven-dimensional supertranslation algebra is a complex super Lie algebra of the form
\[
  \ft_{11d} = V \oplus \Pi S
\]
where $S$ is the (unique) spin representation and $V \cong \CC^{11}$ the complex vector representation, of~$\lie{so}(11, \CC)$. 
The bracket is the unique surjective $\lie{so}(11,\CC)$-equivariant map from the symmetric square of~$S$ to~$V$;
this decomposes into three irreducibles, 
\beqn\label{eqn:decomp}
  \Sym^2(S) \cong V \oplus \wedge^2 V \oplus \wedge^5 V.
\eeqn
Denote by $\Gamma_{\wedge^1}, \Gamma_{\wedge^2}, \Gamma_{\wedge^5}$ the projections onto each of the summands above. 
The bracket in $\ft_{11d}$ is defined using the first projection
\[
[\psi, \psi'] = \Gamma_{\wedge^1} (\psi, \psi') .
\]
The super Poincar\'{e} algebra is
\[
  \lie{siso}_{11d} = \lie{so}(11 , \CC) \ltimes \ft_{11d} .
\]
The $R$-symmetry is trivial in 11-dimensional supersymmetry. 

\subsection{Central extensions of the supersymmetry algebra} 
\label{sec:m2brane}

Extensions of the supersymmetry algebra correspond to the existence of extended objects, such as branes, in the supergravity theory \brian{good reference?}. 
In 11-dimensional supersymmetry, there are two such extensions corresponding to the $M2$ brane and the $M5$ brane.
We begin by describing a less standard dg Lie algebra model for the $M2$ brane algebra.
In the next section we will explain the relationship to other descriptions in terms of $L_\infty$ algebras \cite{Basu_2005,Bagger_2007,fiorenza2015super}. 

Our model for the $M2$ brane algebra is a dg Lie algebra extension of the super Poincar\'e algebra $\lie{siso}_{11d}$.
Introduce the cochain complex $\Omega^{\bu}(\RR^{11})$ of (complex valued) differential forms on $\RR^{11}$ equipped with the de Rham differential $\d$.
 
The $M2$ brane algebra arises as a central extension of $\lie{siso}_{11d}$ by the cochain complex $\Omega^\bu(\RR^{11})[2]$ and is defined by a cocycle
\[
    c_{M2} \in \clie^{2,+} \left(\lie{siso}_{11d} \; ; \; \Omega^\bu (\RR^{11})[2]\right) .
\]
The formula is
  \[c_{M2} (\psi, \psi') = \Gamma_{\wedge^2}(\psi, \psi') \in \Omega^2(\RR^{11})\]
  where $\Gamma_{\wedge^2}$ is the projection onto $\wedge^2 V$, thought of as the space of constant coefficient two-forms, as in the decomposition \eqref{eqn:decomp}.
  
Here, we are using a bigrading by $\ZZ \times \ZZ/2$. 
The super Poincar\'e algebra is concentrated in zero integer grading and carries is natural $\ZZ/2$ grading as a super Lie algebra.
The complex $\Omega^{\bu}(\RR^{11})[2]$ is concentrated in integer degrees $[-2,9]$ and has even parity.

\begin{dfn}
The algebra $\m2$ is the $\ZZ \times \ZZ/2$-graded dg Lie algebra defined by the central extension of $\lie{siso}_{11d}$ by the cocycle $c_{M2}$.  
\end{dfn}

The bracket in $\m2$ is bidegree $(0,+)$ and the differential is bidegree $(1,+)$.

\subsection{The minimal twist}
\label{sec:mintwist}

Fix a rank one supercharge $Q \in S$ satisfying $Q^2 = 0$.
Such a supercharge defines the minimal twist of 11-dimensional supersymmetry. 
\brian{cite \cite{SWspinor}}
We characterize the cohomology of the algebra $\m2$ with respect to this supercharge. 

$Q$ defines a maximal isotropic subspace $L \subset V$. 
In turn, we will decompose the super Poincar\'e algebra into $\lie{sl}(L) = \lie{sl}(5)$ representations.
First, the defining and spinor representations decompose as
\deq{
  V = L \oplus L^\vee \oplus \CC_t, \qquad S = \wedge^\bu L^\vee.
}
In the expression for $S$, we are omitting factors of $\det(L)^{\frac12}$ for simplicity. 
Also, $\lie{so}(11, \CC)$ decomposes as
\[
\lie{sl}(5) \oplus \wedge^2 L \oplus \wedge^2 L^\vee \oplus L \oplus L^\vee .
\]
Furthermore, the spinorial representation can be identified with
\[
S = \wedge^\bu (L^\vee) = \CC \oplus L^\vee \oplus \wedge^2 L^\vee \oplus \wedge^3 L^\vee \oplus \wedge^4 L^\vee \oplus \wedge^5 L^\vee .
\]
The element $Q$ lives in the first summand.
Let ${\rm Stab}(Q) \subset \lie{so}(11,\CC)$ be the stabilizer of $Q$. 
This is a parabolic subalgebra whose Levi factor is $\lie{sl}(5)$.

\subsection{$Q$-cohomology of $\m2$}
\label{sec:m2branetwist}

Any element $Q \in S$ satisfying $Q^2 = 0$ determines a deformation of the dg Lie algebra $\m2$.
To deform $\d$ by $Q$ we must break the $\ZZ \times \ZZ/2$ bigrading.
The supercharge $Q$ is odd and of cohomological degree zero.
Recall, the original differential on $\m2$ is the de Rham differential $\d$ which just acts on the central summand and is even of cohomological degree $+1$.
Thus, only the totalized $\ZZ/2$ grading makes the differential $\d + [Q,-]$ homogenous. 

\begin{dfn}
The $Q$-twist $\m2^Q$ of $\m2$ is the super dg Lie algebra whose differential is $\d + [Q,-]$.
The bracket is unchanged.
\end{dfn}

We now assume that $Q$ is a rank one, or minimal, supercharge satisfying $Q^2 = 0$. 

\begin{prop}\label{prop:susycoh}
As a $\ZZ/2$ graded space, the cohomology of the $Q$-twist $\m2^Q$ is
\beqn\label{eqn:susycoh}
L^\vee \oplus {\rm Stab}(Q) \oplus \Pi \left(\wedge^2 L\right) \oplus \CC
\eeqn
whose elements we denote by $(v, m, \psi, c)$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item As a super Lie algebra, the cohomology of $\m2^Q$ is the natural extension of ${\rm Stab}(Q)$ together with the bracket
\beqn\label{eqn:susy2bra}
[\psi, \psi']_2 = \psi \wedge \psi' \in \wedge^4 L \cong L^\vee_v \\
\eeqn
\item 
$\m2^Q$ is not formal as a super dg Lie algebra.
As a super $L_\infty$ algebra, the $Q$-twist is equivalent to \eqref{eqn:susycoh} with $2$-brackets described in (1) where we additionally introduce the $3$-ary bracket 
\beqn\label{eqn:susy3bra}
[v, v', \psi]_3 = \<v \wedge v', \psi\> \in \CC_c .
\eeqn
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\parsec[]

One outcome of this proposition is that the dg Lie algebra $\m2^Q$ is {\em not} formal; there is a 3-ary $L_\infty$ bracket present in cohomology. 
One way to prove the proposition above is to use homotopy transfer directly to $\m2^Q$, just as we did in \S \ref{s:ht} to deduce the form of the $3$-ary bracket. 
Instead, we will use the following minimal model for $\m2^Q$ to prove Proposition \ref{prop:susycoh}.
This minimal model also has the advantage of being more directly related to the 11-dimensional supergravity theory.

\begin{lem}
\label{lem:gmodel}
Let $\fg$ denote the following $\ZZ/2$ graded dg Lie algebra which as a cochain complex is
\[
H^\bu(\m2^Q) \oplus (L \xto{\id} \Pi L)  .
\]
Denote the elements of the second summand by $(\lambda, \til\lambda)$. 
The Lie structure extends the one on $H^\bu(\m2^Q)$ described in (1) of Proposition \ref{prop:susycoh} together with the brackets
\begin{align*}
[v,\lambda] & = \<v, \lambda\> \in \CC_c \\ 
[v,\psi] & = \<v, \psi\> \in \Pi L_{\Tilde{\lambda}}.
\end{align*}

There is an $L_\infty$ map 
\[
\fg \rightsquigarrow \m2^Q
\] 
which is a quasi-isomorphism of cochain complexes.  
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}

The cohomology of the non-centrally extended algebra was computed in \cite{SWspinor}, we briefly recall the result. 
The element $Q$ only acts nontrivially on the summands $\wedge^4 L^\vee$ and $\wedge^5 L^\vee$ in $S$. 
The image of $\wedge^4 L^\vee \cong L$ trivializes the antiholomorphic translations while the image of $\wedge^5 L^\vee$ trivializes the time translation.
So, of the translations, only the holomorphic ones $L^\vee$ survive.
The map 
\[
[Q,-] \colon \lie{so}(11,\CC) \to S 
\] 
is the projection onto $\wedge^0 L^\vee \oplus \wedge^1 L^\vee \oplus \wedge^2 L^\vee$. 
The kernel of $[Q,-]$ is the stabilizer~${\rm Stab}(Q)$.

In summary, the space of odd translations which survive cohomology is $\wedge^3 L^\vee \cong \wedge^2 L$.
This completes the calculation of the cohomology. 

We embed $\fg$ into $\m2^Q$ in the following way: ${\rm Stab}(Q)$ and $L^\vee$ sit inside in the evident way.
The central element maps to $c \mapsto - 1 \in \Omega^0(\RR^{11})$.
The summand $L_\lambda$ is mapped to the linear functions in $\Omega^0(\RR^{11})$ and $\Pi L_{\Tilde{\lambda}}$ is sent to the constant coefficient one-forms in $\Pi \Omega^1(\RR^{11})$. 
It remains to define where $\psi \in \wedge^2 L$ is mapped.

Notice that naively, $\psi \in \wedge^2 L$ is not $Q$-closed due to the presence of the central extension. 
To embed $\wedge^2 L$ we introduce the following operator
\[
H \colon \Omega^2 (\RR^{11}) \to \Omega^1(\RR^{11})
\]
which sends a two-form $\alpha$ to the one-form $H \alpha$ defined by the formula $(H \alpha) (x) = \int_0^x \alpha$
where we integrate over a straight line path from $0$ to $x$.

Notice that if $\alpha$ is $\d$-closed then $\d (H \alpha) = \alpha$. 
It follows that any element $\psi \in \wedge^2 L \subset S$ can be lifted to a closed element at the cochain level in $\m2^Q$ by the formula
\[
\Tilde{\psi} = \psi - H \Gamma_{\wedge^2} (Q, \psi) \in \Pi S \oplus \Pi \Omega^1 .
\]
Thus, sending $\psi \mapsto \Tilde{\psi}$ defines a cochain map $\fg \to \m2^Q$. 

The Lie bracket $[\Tilde{\psi}, \Tilde{\psi}']$ agrees with $[\psi, \psi']$. 
On the other hand, in $\m2^Q$ there is the Lie bracket 
\[
[v,\Tilde{\psi}] = - L_v (H \Gamma_{\wedge^2} (Q, \psi)) = -\<v, \Gamma_{\wedge^2}(Q, \psi)\> - \d \<v, H \Gamma_{\wedge^2}(Q, \psi)\> .
\]
The first term agrees with the bracket $[v, \psi]_{\fg}$ in $\fg$. 
The other term is exact in $\m2^Q$ and can hence be corrected by the following bilinear  
\[
v \otimes \psi \mapsto \<v, H \Gamma_{\wedge^2} (Q,\psi) \> \in L_\lambda .
\] 
Together with the cochain map described above, this bilinear term prescribes the desired $L_\infty$ map. 

\end{proof}

Using the model $\fg$ the first part of Proposition \ref{prop:susycoh} follows immediately. 
We deduce the second part using homotopy transfer. 

Recall that we described the cohomology of $\m2^Q$ in \eqref{eqn:susycoh}.
Let $\delta$ denote the differential on $\fg$ which simply maps $\Pi L$ to $L$ by the identity map. 
We produce the homotopy data
\begin{equation}
\begin{tikzcd}
\arrow[loop left]{l}{K}(\fg , \delta)\arrow[r, shift left, "q"] &(H^\bu(\m2^Q) \, , \, 0)\arrow[l, shift left, "i"] \: ,
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
as follows.
\begin{itemize}
\item The operator $K$ annihilates $H^\bu(\m2^Q)$ and is the identity map~$K \colon \Pi L_{\til \lambda} \to L_\lambda$. 
\item The map $q$ is the identity on $H^\bu(\m2^Q)$ and annihilates the summand~$L \to \Pi L$. 
\item The map $i$ embeds $H^\bu(\m2^Q)$ in the obvious way. 
\end{itemize}

It is immediate to verify this data prescribes valid homotopy data.
There is only a single term in the $L_\infty$ structure generated by homotopy transfer. 
It is determined by the following tree diagram. 
\brian{do it}
This recovers the formula in (2) of Proposition \ref{prop:susycoh}.

\subsection{Embedding supersymmetry into the 11-dimensional theory} \label{s:residual}

Consider now the super $L_\infty$ algebra $\cL$ underlying the eleven-dimensional theory on $\CC^5 \times \RR$. 

\begin{prop}
There is a map of super $L_\infty$ algebras 
\[
\fg \rightsquigarrow \cL 
\]
where $\fg$ is the model for the $Q$-cohomology of the super Lie algebra $\m2$ from Proposition \ref{lem:gmodel}. 
In particular, the $Q$-twisted algebra $\m2^Q \simeq \fg$ is a symmetry of 11-dimensional theory on $\CC^5 \times \RR$. 
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Recall the model $\fg$ takes the following form
\beqn 
\begin{tikzcd}
\ul{even} & \ul{odd} & \ul{even} \\
 L_1 & \wedge^2 L_2 & L^\vee \\
\wedge^2 L_1 & & \\
\lie{sl}(5) \\
L_2 \ar[r, "\id"] & L_3 \\ 
\CC_c & .
\end{tikzcd}
\eeqn
The subscripts in $L_1, L_2, L_3$ are used to distinguish between the various copies of $L$.

The $L_\infty$ map from the dg Lie model $\fg$ to the fields of the twisted $11$-dimensional supergravity theory has a linear $\Phi^{(1)}$ and quadratic $\Phi^{(2)}$ piece
The linear piece $\Phi^{(1)} \colon \fg \to \cL$ is
\begin{align*}
 L_1 & \mapsto 0 \\
 \wedge^2 L_1 & \mapsto 0 \\
z_i \wedge z_j \in \wedge^2 L_2 & \mapsto \frac12 (z_i \d z_j - z_j \d z_i) \in \Omega^{1,0} (\CC^5) \hotimes \Omega^0 (\RR) \\
A_{ij} \in \lie{sl}(5) & \mapsto \sum_{ij} A_{ij} z_i \in \PV^{1,0}(\CC^5) \hotimes \Omega^0(\RR) \\\frac{\partial}{\partial z_j} \in L^\vee & \mapsto
\frac{\partial}{\partial z_i} \in \PV^{1,0} (\CC^5) \hotimes \Omega^0 (\RR^5) \\ z_i \in L_2 & \mapsto z_i \in \Omega^{0,0}(\CC^5) \hotimes \Omega^0 (\RR) \\
z_i \in L_3 & \mapsto \d z_i \in \Omega^{1,0}(\CC^5) \hotimes \Omega^0 (\RR) \\
1 \in \CC_c & \mapsto 1 \in \Omega^{0,0}(\CC^5) \hotimes \Omega^0 (\RR) .
\end{align*}

It is immediate to check that this is a map of cochain complexes where one equips $\cL$ with the linear BRST differential \eqref{eqn:linearBRST}.
Since $\nu$ does not appear in the image of this map, to check that the higher Lie brackets are preserved one only needs to check that the $2$-ary brackets along with a single $3$-ary bracket. 
The preservation of the $2$-ary brackets are clear, however the linear map $\Phi^{(1)}$ defined above is {\em not} compatible with the $3$-ary bracket present in the 11-dimensional theory
\[
\left[\partial_{z_i}, \partial_{z_j} , \frac12 (z_k \d z_\ell - z_\ell \d z_k) \right]_3 = \delta_k^i \delta_\ell^j - \delta_\ell^i \delta_k^j \in \Omega^{0,0}(\CC^5) \otimes \Omega^0(\RR) 
\]
which arises from the quartic part of the action $\frac12 \int \frac{1}{1-\nu} \mu^2 \vee \del \gamma$. 

To remedy this, we introduce the odd bilinear map $\Phi^{(2)} \colon \fg \times \fg \to \Pi \cL$ defined by 
\[
\Phi^{(2)} \left(\partial_{z_i} , z_k \wedge z_\ell\right) = \delta^i_k z_\ell - \delta^i_\ell z_k .
\]
To see that $\Phi^{(1)} + \Phi^{(2)}$ prescribes an $L_\infty$ map $\fg \rightsquigarrow \cL$ we need to observe the relation
\[
\left[\Phi^{(1)}(\partial_{z_i}), \Phi^{(1)} (\partial_{z_j}), \Phi^{(1)}(z_k \wedge z_\ell) \right]_3 = \left[\partial_{z_i}, \Phi^{(2)}(\partial_{z_j}, z_k \wedge z_\ell) \right]_2
\]
which is apparent. 
\end{proof}

Because this map preserves differentials, it descends to a map in cohomology. 
We have already computed the cohomology of $\cL$ on $\CC^5 \times \RR$, it is the trivial one-dimensional central extension of $E (5,10)$. 
The Lie algebra structure present in the cohomology of $\m2^Q$ is described in part (1) of Proposition \ref{prop:susycoh}. 
The map
\[
L^\vee \oplus {\rm Stab}(Q) \oplus \Pi \left(\wedge^3 L^\vee\right) \oplus \CC_c \to E (5,10) \oplus \CC_{c'}
\]
is defined by very similar formulas as above
\begin{align*}
 L_1 & \mapsto 0 \\
 \wedge^2 L_1 & \mapsto 0 \\
z_i \wedge z_j \in \wedge^2 L_2 & \mapsto \d z_i \wedge \d z_j \in \Omega^{2}_{cl} (\CC^5) \\
A_{ij} \in \lie{sl}(5) & \mapsto \sum_{ij} A_{ij} z_i \in \Vect_0(\CC^5) \\ \frac{\partial}{\partial z_j} \in L^\vee & \mapsto
\frac{\partial}{\partial z_i} \in \Vect_0(\CC^5) \\
c \in \CC_c & \mapsto c \in \CC_{c'} .
\end{align*}

The relationship between the transferred $L_\infty$ structures can be described as follows. 
Recall, that the linear BRST cohomology of the parity shift of the fields of the 11-dimensional theory is equivalent to the super $L_\infty$ 
algebra $\Hat{E(5,10)}$ which is a central extension $E(5,10)$ by the cocycle \eqref{eqn:cocycle}.
Also, we described the $L_\infty$ structure present in the cohomology of $\m2^Q$ in part (2) of Proposition \ref{prop:susycoh}. 
Each of these $L_\infty$ structure involved introducing a single new $3$-ary bracket, which are easily seen to be compatible.

In this section we compare to the work of \brian{Linfty refs}.
In these references, the algebra $\m2$ is defined as an $L_\infty$  
central extension of $\lie{siso}_{11d}$. 

Recall that given two spinors $\psi, \psi' \in S$ we can form the constant coefficient two-form $\Gamma_{\wedge^2} (\psi, \psi')$. 
Using this two-form we can define the following four-linear expression
\[
\mu_2 (\psi, \psi',v,v') = \<v \wedge v', \Gamma(\psi, \psi')\> .
\]
This expression is symmetric on the spinors and anti-symmetric on the vectors, therefore it defines an element in $\clie^4(\ft_{11d})$. 
In \cite{??} it is shown that this cocycle $\mu_2$ is 

%For clarity we adjust notation for $\lie{sl}(5)$-representations. Denote by $V^{1,0} = L^\vee$ the space of holomorphic translations on $\CC^5$ and $V^{\vee 1,0}$ the translation invariant holomorphic one-forms on $\CC^5$.
