\section{An alternative description of the 11-dimensional theory} 
In \S \ref{s:dfn} we have described a family of BV theories on $X \times L$ where $X$ is an odd-dimensional Calabi--Yau manifold and $L$ is an odd-dimensional smooth manifold. 
The space of fields \eqref{eq:sympfields} is equipped with an odd symplectic pairing. 


There is a related, alternative description of this formal moduli space which is almost equivalent. 
Consider the resolution of holomorphic closed two-forms 
\beqn\label{eqn:twoform}
\Omega_{cl}^{2,hol}(X) \simeq \Omega^{2,\bu}(X) \xto{\del} \Omega^{3,\bu}(X)[-1] \to \cdots 
\eeqn
where we have left the $\dbar$-differential implicit, as always. 

There is a map from the two-term complex 
\[
\Omega^{0,\bu}(X)[1] \to \Omega^{1,\bu}(X)
\]
to the resolution \eqref{eqn:twoform} defined by the holomorphic de Rham operator $\del$. 
This map is almost a quasi-isomorphism of sheaves; it differs by copy of constant functions $\CC[1]$ in cohomological degree $-1$. 

Similarly, we can tensor with the dg algebra of de Rham forms on $L$ to obtain a map of $\ZZ/2$-graded cochain complexes
\[
\bigg(\Pi \Omega^{0,\bu}(X;L) \xto{\del} \Omega^{1,\bu}(X;L) \bigg) \xto{\del} \bigg(\Omega^{2,\bu}(X;L) \xto{\del} \Pi \Omega^{3,\bu}(X;L) \to \cdots \bigg) .
\]
Again, this map is a quasi-isomorphism up to a copy of $\Pi \CC$.
The left-hand side contains the fields $(\beta, \gamma)$. 
This map has the effect of sending $\beta \mapsto 0$ and $\gamma \mapsto \partial \gamma \in \Omega^{2,\bu}(X;L)$. 

The basic idea is to replace the complex where $(\beta,\gamma)$ live by this resolution of closed two-forms. 
The new space of fields is 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:poissfields} 
  \begin{tikzcd}[row sep = 1 ex]
     - & + & - & + \\ \hline
     \PV^{1,\bu}(X; L) \ar[r, "\div"] & \PV^{0,\bu}(X; L) \\
     & \Omega^{2,\bu}(X;L) \ar[r, "\del"] & \Omega^{3,\bu}(X;L) \ar[r] & \cdots 
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}

It may seem that this description of the fields of the 11-dimensional theory is not much different than the original formulation---at the level of the free theory they only differ by a copy of constant functions in odd cohomological degree. 
We'd like to point out two main differences:
\begin{itemize}
\item This new description does not have the structure of a BV theory in the usual sense; there is no odd symplectic pairing on the fields. 
Nevertheless, there is still an odd Poisson bracket acting on functionals of the fields which we will describe momentarily. 
For this reason, we will refer to the theory as a ``Poisson BV theory''. 
\item With the existence of the odd Poisson bracket one might be optimistic to formulate the CME for this Poisson BV theory.
However, there is no local interaction which is consistent with the local interaction present in the original BV theory. 
Nevertheless, the (shift of the) fields is equipped with an $L_\infty$ structure which is compatible with the odd Poisson bracket. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{prop}
The complex \eqref{eq:poissfields} is equipped with the structure of an interacting Poisson BV theory.
Let $\cG = \cG(X \times L)$ be the resulting $L_\infty$ algebra...
\end{prop}

Heuristically, we can write the action in the following non-local form
\[
\frac{1}{1-\nu} \mu^2 \eta + (\del^{-1} \eta) \eta^2 .
\]
\brian{are there more terms involving higher forms?}

The first few nonzero brackets are
\begin{align*}
[\mu]_1 & = \dbar \mu + \div \mu \\
[\eta]_1 & = \dbar \eta + \del \eta \\ 
[\mu_1,\mu_2]_2 & = \div (\mu_1 \wedge \mu_2) \\
[\mu, \eta]_2 & = \mu \vee \del \eta \\
[\eta_1,\eta_2]_2 & = \# \Omega^{-1} \vee (\eta_1 \wedge \eta_2)  \\
[\nu, \mu_1,\mu_2]_3 & = \div(\nu \mu_1 \mu_2) \\
[\nu, \mu,\eta]_3 & = \nu \mu \del \eta
\end{align*}
\brian{coefficients}
For $k \geq 2$ the general formula for the $k$-ary bracket is 
\begin{align*}
[\eta_1,\eta_2]_2 & = \# \Omega^{-1} \vee (\eta_1 \wedge \eta_2)  \\
[\nu_1,\nu_2, \ldots, \nu_{k-2}, \mu_1,\mu_2]_{k} & = \# \div(\nu_1 \cdots \nu_{k-2} \mu_1 \wedge \mu_2) \\ 
[\nu_1,\nu_2, \ldots, \nu_{k-2}, \mu,\eta]_{k} & = \# \nu_1 \cdots \nu_{k-2} (\mu \vee \del \eta) .
\end{align*}

\parsec[]
Consider the theory on $\CC^3 \times \RR$. 
There is a quasi-isomorphism of $L_\infty$ Lie algebras $\CC \simeq \cG (\CC^3 \times \RR)$. 

\parsec[]
Consider the theory on $\CC^5 \times \RR$. 

\begin{prop}
There is a quasi-isomorphism of super $L_\infty$ algebras 
\[
E(5,10) \xto{\simeq} \cG(\CC^5 \times \RR) .
\]
This lifts to map of super $L_\infty$ algebras $E(5,10) \to \cL(\CC^5 \times \RR)$ whose kernel is $\CC$.
\end{prop}


\section{BCOV stuff}

\subsection{Relation to BCOV theory}

\parsec[sec:pv] 
\ingmar{a section defining polyvector fields; not sure where this belong}
Equipped with this structure, the complex we have written maps in an obvious way into the complex of polyvector fields on~$X$. Recall that one defines
\deq{
  \PV^{i,j}(X) = \Omega^{0,j}(X, \wedge^i \T_X).
}
\ingmar{Wedges look super fucked up}
The complex $\PV^{\bu,\bu}$ is equipped with two natural differentials: the Dolbeault operator $\dbar$, of $(i,j)$-degree $(0,1)$, and the holomorphic divergence operator $\div$, which carries $(i,j)$-degree $(-1,0)$. Assigning total degree $- i + j$ to $\PV^{i,j}$ thus gives the total polyvector fields the structure of a bicomplex. We will use the shorthand notation $\PV^i = (\PV^{i,\bu}, \dbar )$ for the Dolbeault resolution of holomorphic $i$-polyvector fields. 

\subsubsection{}
It will be convenient for us to cast this dg Lie algebra in a slightly different way.
We construct a different model for the Lie algebra of divergence-free vector fields whose underlying cochain complex is the same as \eqref{eqn:cplx1}. 
The distinguishing feature is that this model is no longer a dg Lie algebra, but an $L_\infty$ algebra. 

The model we use is motivated by the topological string, specifically the description of the closed topological string in terms of Kodaira--Spencer theory \cite{BCOV}.
We recall the requisite background, but refer to \cite{CLbcov1,CLbcov2,CLtypeI} for more details. 

Suppose $X$ be a Calabi--Yau manifold of dimension $d$. 
Let $\PV^{k,\bu}(X)$ denote the Dolbeault complex of the holomorphic vector bundle $\wedge^k \T_X$; we will omit $X$ in this section and write $\PV^{k,\bu}$ for simplicity.
In particular, $\PV^{k,j}$ is the space of smooth sections of the bundle $\wedge^j \T_X^* \otimes \wedge^k \T_X$. 
With this notation, the dg Lie algebra in \eqref{eqn:cplx1} is $\PV^{1,\bu} \oplus \PV^{0,\bu}[-1]$ with differential $\dbar + \div$. 

Introduce a formal parameter $u$ of cohomological degree $+2$ and consider the complex 
\beqn\label{eqn:pv1}
\PV^{\bu,\bu} [[u]] [1]
\eeqn
with differential $\dbar + u \div$ which we will often denote just by $Q_{KS}$ and refer to as the linear BRST differential. 
With our conventions, notice that $u^l \PV^{k,j}$ sits in cohomological degree $2l +k + j - 1$. 

The Schouten--Nijenhuis bracket 
\[
[-,-] \colon \PV^{k,j} \times \PV^{p,q} \to \PV^{p+k-1,j+q} 
\]
extends $u$-linearly to endow \eqref{eqn:pv1} with the structure of a dg Lie algebra.
We refer to this as the Kodaira--Spencer, or strict, dg Lie algebra structure.
We refer to the further cohomological shift 
\[
\cE_{KS} = \PV^{\bu,\bu} [[u]] [2]
\]
as the space of fields of Kodaira--Spencer theory.

Notice that the complex resolving divergence-free vector fields \eqref{eqn:cplx1} sits inside $\cE_{KS} [-1]$ as a sub dg Lie algebra as $\PV^{1,\bu} \oplus u \PV^{0,\bu}[1]$. 

\subsubsection{}

\brian{bv bracket}

\subsubsection{}

Together with the linear BRST differential $Q_{KS}$, the bracket $\{-,-\}_{KS}$ induces the structure of a dg Lie algebra the cohomological shift of the space of local functionals $\oloc(\cE_{KS})[-2d+5]$. 

\begin{thm}[\cite{CLbcov1}]
The BCOV action 
\[
I_{BCOV} \in \oloc \left(\cE_{KS} \right) 
\]
satisfies the classical master equation 
\[
Q_{KS} I_{BCOV} + \frac12 \left\{I_{BCOV}, I_{BCOV}\right\}_{KS} = 0 .
\]
In other words, $I_{BCOV}$ determines a Maurer--Cartan element in the dg Lie algebra $\oloc(\cE_{KS})[-2d+5]$.
\end{thm}

This action induces the square-zero operator 
\[
\delta_{BCOV} = Q_{KS} + \{I_{BCOV}, -\} 
\]
acting on observables of the Kodaira--Spencer fields. 
In other words, it defines a non-linear BRST operator; in turn it
induces an $L_\infty$ structure $\{[-]_k\}_{k =1,2,3,\ldots}$ on the complex \eqref{eqn:pv1} whose linear operation is $[-]_1 = Q_{KS} = \dbar + u\div$. 

This $L_\infty$ structure is clearly not identical as the strict dg Lie algebra structure (it has operations of arbitrary high order). 
Nevertheless, it is equivalent to the strict dg Lie model: there is an $L_\infty$ automorphism which exchanges the two structures.

It is easiest to describe this automorphism at the level of observables.
Use the notation $\Sigma$ for a linear observable of the Kodaira--Spencer fields $\cE_{KS}$. 
Then, the Kodaira--Spencer dg Lie algebra structure induces the non-linear BRST operator $\delta_{KS}$ given by
\[
\delta_{KS} (\Sigma) = Q_{KS} \Sigma + \frac12 [\Sigma,\Sigma] .
\]

The non-linear change of coordinates relating the two structures is defined by
\[
\Psi \colon \Sigma \mapsto \left[u (e^{\Sigma/u} -1)\right]_+
\]
where $[-]_+$ projects onto the non-negative powers of $u$.  

\parsec[]

The complex resolving the (shift of) divergence-free vector fields 
\[
\left(\PV^{1,\bu}[1] \oplus u \PV^{0,\bu}[2] \, , \, \dbar + u \div\right) 
\]
is a subcomplex of $\cE_{KS}$.
If $d = \dim_\CC(X)=3$ then the shifted Poisson bivector $\Pi_{BCOV}$ restricts to a shifted Poisson bivector on this subcomplex. 
In particular, the action $I_{BCOV}$ restricts to a solution to the classical master equation for this subcomplex. 

If $d \ne 3$ then there is the following subcomplex $\til{\cE}_{KS}\subset \cE_{KS}$ defined by:
\beqn\label{eqn:tilks}
\begin{tikzcd}
\ul{-1} & \ul{0} & \cdots & \ul{d-4} & \ul{d-3} & \cdots    \\
\PV^{1,\bu} \ar[r] & u\PV^{0,\bu} & & & & &  \\
& & & \PV^{d-2, \bu} \ar[r] & u \PV^{d-3, \bu} \ar[r] & \cdots &   .
\end{tikzcd}
\eeqn
And one can check that the shifted Poisson bivector restricts to a shifted Poisson bivector on this subcomplex. 
Thus, we have the following.

\begin{prop}
\label{prop:tilbcov}
The BCOV action $I_{BCOV}$ restricts to a solution of the classical master equation on $\til{\cE}_{KS}$ that we denote by $\til{I}_{BCOV}$. 
\end{prop}

\subsubsection{}

Define the action by the group $\CC^\times$ on the complex $\til{\cE}_{KS}$ as follows.
Declare the first line in \eqref{eqn:tilks} is weight zero and the second line is weight $+1$. 
%Declare $\mu, \nu$ have $\CC^\times$ weight zero and $\beta,\gamma$ have $\CC^\times$ weight $+1$. 
The linear BRST operator is clearly weight zero and the shifted Poisson structure $\Pi_{KS}$ is of weight $+1$. 
Thus, the shifted Poisson bracket $\{-,-\}_{KS}$ is of $\CC^\times$ weight $+1$.

\begin{lem}
The restricted action $\til{I}_{BCOV}$ has $\CC^\times$ weight $-1$. 
In particular, the non-linear BRST operator 
\beqn\label{eqn:KSbrst}
\delta_{BCOV} = Q_{KS} + \{\til{I}_{BCOV},-\}_{KS}
\eeqn
is $\CC^\times$ weight zero.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
%The map $\Phi \colon \cE_{pot} \to \til{\cE}_{KS}$ preserves $\CC^\times$ weight, so it suffices to prove that $\til{I}_{BCOV}$ is weight $+1$. 
We will make use of two gradings on $\til{\cE}_{KS}$. 
The first is holomorphic polyvector field type, and the second is descendant degree.
The summand $u^l \PV^{k,\bu}$ is polyvector type $k$ and descendant degree $l$. 

We introduce notation in this proof that won't be used later on. 
Let $\alpha$ denote a super field living in the first line of \eqref{eqn:tilks} and let $\beta$ denote a super field living in the second line of \eqref{eqn:tilks}.
If a field of type $\alpha$ has polyvector type $k$ then it has descendant degree $1-k$, $k=0,1$. 
If a field of type $\beta$ has polyvector type $l$ then it has descendant degree $d-2-l$.

A homogenous polynomial degree term in the BCOV action $I_{BCOV}$ is a linear combination of functionals of the form
\[
 \alpha_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \alpha_m \wedge \beta_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \beta_n  .
\]
Let $k_i$ be the polyvector field type of $\alpha_i$ and let $l_j$ be the polyvector field type of $\beta_j$. 
In order for this expression to contribute nontrivially to the BCOV action two constraints must hold:
\begin{align*}
\sum_{i=1}^m k_i + \sum_{j=1}^n l_j & = d \\
\sum_{i=1}^m (1-k_i) + \sum_{j=1}^n (d-2-l_j) & = m+n-3 .
\end{align*}
The first constraint ensures that the integrand is of top polyvector degree. 
The second constraint is on the descendant degree, see \brian{ref above}. 

Simplifying these two equations, one finds the condition
\[
m+n-3 = m+(d-2)n - d 
\]
which implies $n=1$, as desired. 
\end{proof}

Consider the cochain complex $\left(\oloc(\til{\cE}_{KS}) \, , \, \delta_{KS} \right)$ of all local functionals equipped with the non-linear BRST differential \eqref{eqn:KSbrst}.  
The $\CC^\times$ weight zero subcomplex is 
\[
\big(\oloc(\til\cE_{KS})^{(0)} \, , \, \delta_{KS} \big) = \big(\oloc(\cE_0) \, , \, \delta_{KS} \big) 
\]
where $\cE_0 = \PV^{1,\bu}[1] \oplus u \PV^{0,\bu}$ is the subcomplex of the fields $\til\cE_{KS}$ comprising the first line of \eqref{eqn:tilks}.

\begin{prop}
\label{prop:Linfty}
The differential $\delta_{KS}$ acting on the weight zero fields induces a local $L_\infty$ algebra structure on the complex of vector bundles 
\[
\cE_0 [-1] = \PV^{1,\bu} \oplus \PV^{0,\bu}[-1]
\]
with $[-]_1 = \dbar + \div$. 
Furthermore, this $L_\infty$ algebra structure is equivalent to the strict dg Lie algebra structure on the resolution of divergence-free vector fields defined in \S \ref{sec:divfree}. 
\end{prop}

%Applying this to the $k$th exterior power of the holomorphic tangent bundle $V = \wedge^k \T_X$, we obtain a resolution of the sheaf of $k$-linear polyvector fields which we denote by $\PV^{k,\bu} (X) = \Omega^{0,\bu}(X, \wedge^k \T_X)$. 

%\subsubsection{}
%
%Consider the following cochain complex $\cE_{pot}$:
%\beqn\label{eqn:E}
%\begin{tikzcd}
%\ul{-1} & \ul{0} & \cdots & \ul{d-5} & \ul{d-4} &   \\

%& & & \Omega^{0, \bu} \ar[r,"\del"] & \Omega^{1, \bu} 
%\end{tikzcd}
%\eeqn
%We will refer to the components of the fields using the notation

%(\beta, \gamma) & \in \Omega^{0,\bu}(X)[d-5] \oplus \Omega^{1,\bu}(X) [d-4].
%\end{align*}
%The expressions $\mu,\nu,\beta,\gamma$ are still super fields in the sense that they have components in all anti-holomorphic Dolbeault degree.
