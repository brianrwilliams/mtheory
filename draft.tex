%Can we try to roughly say where each of our twisted fields come from in the untwisted theory? I imagine this section being pretty chill and mostly to orient physicists. 

\section{Twisted supergavity on AdS space}

\subsection{Superconformal algebras}

\begin{prop}
The $Q$-cohomology of the 6d $\cN=(2,0)$ superconformal algebra and the 3d $\cN=8$ superconformal algebra is isomorphic to the super Lie algebra $\lie{osp}(6|1)$. 
\end{prop} 


\subsection{The ${\rm AdS}_7 \times S^4$ background}

\parsec[]

Choose a splitting 
\[
\CC^5 \times \RR = \CC_z^3 \times \CC_w^2 \times \RR
\]
and denote coordinates $z_i, i=1,2,3$ and $w_a, a=1,2$.

The bosonic part of $\lie{osp}(6|1)$ is the direct sum Lie algebra
\[
\lie{sl}(4) \oplus \lie{sl}(2) .
\]
which we write as $\lie{sl}(W) \oplus \lie{sl}(R)$ with $W,R$ complex four, two dimensional complex vector spaces. 

The embedding of the bosonic piece can roughly be described as follows. 
The Lie algebra $\lie{sl}(4)$ represents conformal transformations along the plane $\CC^3_z$.
Since not all such infinitesimal transformations are divergence-free, there precise formulas must be adjusted.   
The Lie algebra $\lie{sl}(2)$ represents rotations in $\CC^2_w$; the vector fields representing these transformations are automatically divergence free.


\begin{itemize}

\item
The bosonic abelian subalgebra $\CC^3 \subset \lie{sl}(4)$ is mapped to the translations 
\[
\frac{\del}{\del z_i} \in \PV^{1,0}(\CC^5) \otimes \Omega^0(\RR) , \quad i=1,2,3.
\]

\item
The bosonic subalgebra $\lie{sl}(3) \subset \lie{sl}(4)$ is mapped to the 
rotations
\[
A_{ij} z_i \frac{\del}{\del z_j} \in \PV^{1,0}(\CC^5)\otimes \Omega^0(\RR) , \quad (A_{ij}) \in \lie{sl}(3) .
\]

\item
The bosonic subalgebra $\CC \subset \lie{sl}(4)$ is mapped to the element
\[
\sum_{i=1}^3 z_i \frac{\del}{\del z_i} - \frac32 \sum_{a=1}^2 w_a \frac{\del}{\del w_a} \in \PV^{1,0}(\CC^5) \otimes \Omega^0(\RR)  .
\] 
Notice that these vector fields are divergence-free and restrict to the ordinary dilation along $w=0$. 
\item 
The bosonic subalgebra of $\lie{sl}(4)$ describing special conformal transformations on $\CC^3$ is mapped to the elements 
\[
z_i \left(\sum_{i=1}^3 z_i \frac{\del}{\del z_i} - 2 \sum_{a=1}^2 w_a \frac{\del}{\del w_a} \right) \in \PV^{1,0}(\CC^5) \otimes \Omega^0(\RR) .
\] 
Notice that these vector fields are divergence-free and restrict to the ordinary special conformal transformations along $w=0$. 
\item 
The bosonic summand $\lie{sl}(2)$ is mapped to the triple
\[
w_1 \frac{\del}{\del w_2}, w_2 \frac{\del}{\del w_1}, \frac12 \left(w_1 \frac{\del}{\del w_1} - w_2 \frac{\del}{\del w_2}\right) \in \PV^{1,0}(\CC^5) \otimes \Omega^0(\RR) .
\]
\end{itemize}

The odd part of the algebra $\lie{osp}(6|1)$ is $\wedge^4 W \otimes R$ where $W$ is the fundamental $\lie{sl}(4)$ representation and $R$ is the fundamental $\lie{sl}(2)$ representation. 
It is natural to split $W = L \oplus \CC$ with $L = \CC^3$ the fundamental $\lie{sl}(3) \subset \lie{sl}(4)$ representation. 
Then the odd part decomposes as
\[
L \otimes R \oplus \wedge^2 L \otimes R \cong \CC^3 \otimes \CC^2 \oplus \wedge^2 \CC^3 \otimes \CC .
\]

\begin{itemize} 
\item The summand $L \otimes R$ consists of the remaining 6d superstranlsations. 
It is mapped to the fields 
\[
z_i \d w_a \in \Omega^{1,0}(\CC^5) \otimes \Omega^0(\RR) ,\quad a=1,2, \quad i =1,2,3.
\] 
\item The summand $\wedge^2 L \otimes R$ consists of the remaining 6d superconformal transformations. 
It is mapped to the fields
\[
\ep^{ijk} z_i w_a \d z_j \in \Omega^{1,0}(\CC^5)\otimes \Omega^0(\RR) , \quad a = 1,2, \quad k = 1,2,3. 
\]
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The ${\rm AdS}_4 \times S^7$ background}

\brian{discuss coupling}

\parsec[]

We decompose the 11-dimensional manifold $\CC^5 \times \RR$ as
\[
\CC_z \times \CC^4_w \times \RR .
\]
Based on the discussion above, it is natural to expect that there is a field of twisted 11-dimensional supergravity which sources the twist of a stack of $N$ $M2$ branes living on the submanifold $\CC_z \times \RR \cong \{w=0\}\subset \CC^5$. 

The differential form which sources the brane is an element
\[
\til{F} \in \Omega^{4,3} (\CC^4_w \, \setminus \, 0) \otimes \Omega^{0,0} (\CC_z) \otimes \Omega^{0} (\RR) \subset \Dol\left(\CC^5 \times \RR \, \setminus \, \{w=0\}\right) .
\]
Equivalently, we can think about this as a distributional valued form $\til{F} \in \Bar{\Omega}^{4,3}(\CC^5) \otimes \Omega^0 (\RR)$ which satisfies the distributional equation
\[
\dbar \til{F} = N \delta_{w=0} 
\]
where $\delta_{w=0}$ is the Dirac $\delta$-distributional for the submanifold $\{w=0\} = \CC_z \times \RR$. 

Using the Calabi--Yau form we can identify such a differential form with a field of twisted supergravity. 
Indeed $F = \til{F} \wedge \Omega^{-1}$ is a distributional field of type
\[
F \in \Bar{\PV}^{1,4}(\CC^5) \otimes \Omega^0 (\RR) .
\]
For $F$ to make sense as a background of twisted supergravity it must satisfies the appropriate (possibly nonlinear) equation of motion, which we now verify. 

\begin{lem}
The field 
\[
F = \# N \frac{\sum_{a=1}^4 \wbar_a \d \wbar_1 \cdots \Hat{\d \wbar_a} \cdots \d \wbar_4}{\|w\|^{8}} \partial_z .
\]
satisfies the $\mu$-equation of motion in the presence of a stack of $N$ $M2$ branes sourced by the term $N \Omega^{-1} \delta_{w=0}$:
\[
\dbar F + \div F + \frac12 [F, F] = N \Omega^{-1} \delta_{w=0} 
\]
where we set the field in the component $\gamma \in \Omega^{1,\bu}(\CC^5) \otimes \Omega^\bu(\RR)$ equal to zero. 
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
The equation $\dbar F = N \Omega^{-1} \delta_{w=0}$ characterizes the Bochner--Martinelli kernel representing the residue class on $\CC^4 \, \setminus \, 0$. 
It is clear that $\div F = 0$ and $[F, F] = 0$ by simple type reasons. 
\end{proof}

\parsec[]

Recall the bosonic part of $\lie{osp}(6|1)$ is the direct sum Lie algebra $\lie{sl}(4) \oplus \lie{sl}(2)$. 
For the embedding of the bosonic subalgebra, the roles of $\lie{sl}(4)$ and $\lie{sl}(2)$ are somewhat reversed for the M2 brane as compared to the M5 brane. 
The Lie algebra $\lie{sl}(2)$ represents special conformal transformations in $\CC_z$; the vector fields representing these transformations are not divergence-free so must be slightly adjusted. 
The Lie algebra $\lie{sl}(4)$ represents rotations along the plane $\CC^4_w$.   


\begin{itemize}
\item The bosonic summand $\lie{sl}(2)$ is mapped to the vector fields:
\[
\frac{\del}{\del z} ,\quad z \frac{\del}{\del z} - \frac14 \sum_{a=1}^4 w_a \frac{\del}{\del w_a} , \quad z \left(z \frac{\del}{\del z} - \frac12 \sum_{a=1}^4 w_a \frac{\del}{\del w_a} \right) \in \PV^{1,0}(\CC^5) \otimes \Omega^0(\RR) .
\]
Notice that these vector fields are divergence-free and along $w=0$ reduce to the usual special conformal transformations.
\item The bosonic summand $\lie{sl}(4)$ is mapped to the $4$-dimensional rotations: 
\[
\sum_{a,b=1}^4 B_{ab} w_a \frac{\del}{\del w_b} \in \PV^{1,0}(\CC^5) \otimes \Omega^0(\RR) , \quad (B_{ab}) \in \lie{sl}(4) .
\]
\end{itemize}

The odd part of the algebra $\lie{osp}(6|1)$ is $\wedge^4 W \otimes R$ where $W$ is the fundamental $\lie{sl}(4)$ representation and $R$ is the fundamental $\lie{sl}(2)$ representation. 
It is natural to split $R = \CC_{+1} \oplus \CC_{-1}$ so that the odd part decomposes as
\[
(\wedge^2 \CC^4)_{+1} \otimes (\wedge^2 \CC^4)_{-1} .
\]

\begin{itemize}
\item 
The fermionic summand $(\wedge^2 \CC^4)_{+1}$ consists of the supertranslations. 
It is mapped to the fields: 
\[
\ep^{abcd} w_c \d w_d \in \Omega^{1,0}(\CC^5) \otimes \Omega^0(\RR) , \quad a,b=1,2,3,4. 
\] 
\item The fermionic summand $(\wedge^2 \CC^4)_{-1}$ consists of the remaining superconformal transformations. 
It is mapped to the fields: 
\[
\ep^{abcd} z w_c \d w_d \in \Omega^{1,0}(\CC^5) \otimes \Omega^0(\RR) , \quad a,b=1,2,3,4. 
\] 
\end{itemize}

\section{The non-minimal twist} 

We have provided numerous consistency checks that the 11-dimensional theory defined on $\CC^5 \times \RR$ is a twist of supergravity. 
We have referred to this theory as holomorphic as it depends on the complex structure in the maximal number of directions. 
In this section we characterize a further twist of 11-dimensional supergravity from the lens of the holomorphic theory. 

On flat space, the further twist is essentially unique and renders the theory topological in seven directions, rather than just one in the holomorphic twist. 
We will show that it is equivalent to a theory on $\CC^2 \times \RR^7$ that we call ``Poisson'' Chern--Simons theory. 
In the BV formalism, the theory $\ZZ/2$ graded and has fields given by
\[
A \in \Pi \Omega^{0,\bu}(\CC^2) \hotimes \Omega^\bu(\RR^7) ,
\]
where $\Pi$, as always, denotes parity shift.
The equations of motion are of the form
\[
\dbar A + \d_{\RR^7} A + \partial_{z} A \wedge \partial_{w} A = 0 .
\]
The action functional depends on the holomorphic symplectic structure on $\CC^2$ through the Poisson bracket on the algebra of holomorphic functions.
We give a precise definition below. 

More generally, the twist can be defined \brian{finish}

As a first consistency check, we can compare deformation invariants attached to the holomorphic twist and Poisson Chern-Simons. We will find a match between indices counting local operators supported at a point.

Consider the cartan subalgebra of the bosonic part of $\lie{osp}(6|1)$. Explicitly, the action of this subalgebra on the fields of the holomorphic twist is induced from an action on $\C^5$ with weights as in the following table

\begin{tabluar}

\end{tabular}

\subsection{The non-minimal supercharge}

Let $Q^{hol}$ denote the fixed holomorphic supercharge. 
We have argued in \S \ref{s:residual} that the $Q^{hol}$-cohomology of the 11-dimensional supersymmetry algebra is a symmetry of our proposed holomorphic twist of 11-dimensional supergravity. 

There is a twist of supergravity which can be witnessed as a further deformation of the $Q^{hol}$-twist. 
\brian{fix this}

Recall that the odd component of this residual supersymmetry algebra is
\[
\wedge^2 L \cong \wedge^2(\CC^5) 
\]
which we can identify with constant coefficient holomorphic $(2,0)$ forms on $\CC^5 \times \RR$ (they are zero-forms along the $\RR$-direction). 
Because these forms are constant coefficient, they are also closed, and hence lift to $(1,0)$ forms on $\CC^5 \times \RR$ in a way that is unique up to $\del$-exact terms. 

Using this observation, we constructed an embedding of $\wedge^2(L)$ into the fields of supergravity. 
Explicitly, the element $z_i \wedge z_j \in \wedge^2 L$ was mapped to the $\gamma$-type field
\[
\Psi_{ij} = \frac12 (z_i \d z_j - z_j \d z_i) \in \Omega^{1,0}(\CC^5) \hotimes \Omega^0(\RR) ,
\]
where $i,j=1,\ldots, 5$ and $i \ne j$.  

\parsec[-] 

The first main result of this section is to characterize the twist of our 11-dimensional theory on $\CC^5 \times \RR$ by the element $\Psi_{ij}$. 

\brian{introduce PCS}
Explicitly, if $f,g$ are holomorphic functions on $\CC^2$ then
\[
\{f(z_1,z_2) , g(z_1,z_2)\}_{pb} = \partial_{z_i} f \partial_{z_j} g - \partial_{z_j} f \partial_{z_i} g .
\]

\begin{thm}
The $\Psi_{ij}$-twist of the 11-dimensional theory is equivalent to Poisson Chern--Simons theory on 
\[
\CC_{z_i} \times \CC_{z_j} \times \RR^7 .
\]
\end{thm}

Notice that changing the values of $i,j$ just has the affect of permuting the holomorphic copies of $\CC^2$ leftover in the further twist. 

The Lie algebra of gauge symmetries of this model on flat space is 
\[
\Omega^{0,\bu} (\CC_i \times \CC_j) \hotimes \Omega^\bu(\RR^7) 
\]
which is quasi-isomorphic to $\cO^{hol}(\CC^2)$ equipped with the Poisson bracket $\{-,-\}_{pb}$. 

\parsec[sec:nmsymmetry]
Before proceeding to the proof of the theorem above, we perform a very simple calculation of the global symmetry algebra present in the $\Psi_{ij}$-twisted theory. 

Recall that up to a copy of constant functions, the global symmetry algebra of the holomorphic twist of the 11-dimensional theory is the super Lie algebra $E(5,10)$.
From this point of view, the global symmetry algebra of the $\Psi_{ij}$-twisted theory is given by deformation of this super Lie algebra by the Maurer--Cartan element 
\[
\partial \Psi_{ij} = \d z_i \wedge \d z_j \in \Omega^{2,hol}_{cl}(\CC^5) .
\]
We recall that the space of closed two-forms on $\CC^5$ is precisely the odd part of the super Lie algebra $E(5,10)$. 

Notice that there are the following brackets in the super Lie algebra $E(5,10)$ 
\begin{align*}
[f_l \partial_{z_l} , \d z_i \wedge \d z_j] & = \del f_i \wedge \d z_j - \del f_j \wedge \d z_i \\
[g^{kl} \d z_k \wedge \d z_l , \d z_i \wedge \d z_j ] & = \ep_{ijklm} g^{kl} \partial_{z_m} .
\end{align*}
where $f_l \partial_{z_l}$ is a divergence-free vector field on $\CC^5$ and $g^{kl} \d z_k \wedge \d z_l$ is a closed two-form. 

From these relations, it is easy to see that any divergence-free vector field of the form:
\begin{itemize}
\item $f(z_i, z_j) \partial_{z_i} + g(z_i, z_j) \partial_{z_j}$ for holomorphic functions $f,g$ on $\CC_i \times \CC_j$ or 
\item $f(z_1,\ldots,z_5) \partial_{z_k}$ for $k \ne i$ or $j$
\end{itemize}
are closed for the differential $\d = [\d z_i \wedge \d z_j  , -]$, and that these are the only nonzero closed elements. 
Any element of the second type is clearly exact by the closed two-form $\ep^{ijklm} f \d z_l \d z_m$. 

Thus, the cohomology is the (purely bosonic) Lie algebra of divergence-free vector fields on $\CC^2 = \CC_i \times \CC_j$
\[
H^\bu\big(E(5,10), [\partial \Psi_{ij}, -] \big) \cong \Vect^{hol}_0(\CC_i \times \CC_j) .
\]
Notice that on $\CC^2$, there is a split exact sequence of Lie algebras
\[
0 \to \CC \to \cO^{hol}(\CC^2) \to \Vect_0^{hol} (\CC^2) \to 0
\]
where $\cO^{hol}(\CC^2)$ is equipped with the Poisson bracket with respect to the symplectic form $\d z_i \wedge \d z_j$.
Thus, the Lie algebra of gauge symmetries of Poisson Chern--Simons theory on $\CC_i \times \CC_j \times \RR^7$ is a trivial one-dimensional central extension of the cohomology of $E(5,10)$. 

\section{The twisted $\Omega$-background} 

\subsection{$\Omega$-deformed symmetry algebra}

On flat space, we have 



\subsection{M2 branes in the $\Omega$-background} 

\parsec[]

In the twisted $\Omega$-background a stack of $N$ M2 branes wraps 
\beqn\label{eqn:m2omega}
\{0\} \times \RR \subset \CC^2 \times \RR .
\eeqn

The field which sources this brane is a distributional differential form $F$.
The linear equation of motion for $F$ is the distributional equation 
\[
\d^2 z \wedge \dbar F = N \delta_{z=0} 
\]
where $\delta_{z=0}$ is the $\delta$-distribution for the submanifold \eqref{eqn:m2omega}.  
In what follows we denote $\til{\delta}_{z=0}$ the distributional $(0,2)$ form defined by contracting $\delta_{z=0}$ with the Calabi--Yau form~$\d^2 z$. 

The field $F$ is a smooth Dolbeault form of type $(0,1)$ away from the locus of the brane $\CC^2 \times \RR_t \setminus \{0\} \times \RR \cong (\CC^2 \setminus 0) \times \RR_t$. 
Explicitly, we can characterize it as follows. 

\begin{prop}
The field $F \in \Omega^{0,1} (\CC^2 \setminus 0) \otimes \Omega^{0} (\RR) $ defined by 
\[
F = \# N \frac{\zbar_1 \d \zbar_2 - \zbar_2 \d \zbar_1}{\|z\|^4} 
\] 
satisfies the non-linear equation of motion 
\[
\dbar F + \frac12 F \star_c F = N  \til{\delta}_{z=0} .
\]
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
The equation $\dbar F = N  \til{\delta}_{z=0}$ characterizes the Bochner--Martinelli kernel representing the residue class in $\CC^2 \setminus 0$. 
Since $F$ is a one-form $F \star_c F = 0$ is satisfied by anti-symmetry. 
\end{proof}

\parsec[]

We can interpret $F$ geometrically in the following way. 
Let's first consider just the complex geometric situation, forgetting about the $\RR$-direction. 
 
On any hyper K\"ahler manifold $X$ there is an exact sequence of sheaves of Lie algebras
\[
0 \to \ul\CC \to \cO^{hol}(X) \to \Vect_0^{hol} (X) \to 0
\]
where $\Vect^{hol}_0(X)$ is the Lie algebra of holomorphic divergence-free vector fields and $\cO^{hol}(X)$ is equipped with the Poisson bracket induced by the holomorphic symplectic form. 
The map $\cO^{hol}(X) \to \Vect_0(X)$ is given by the holomorphic de Rham operator $\del \colon \cO^{hol}(X) \to \Omega^{1,hol}_{cl}(X)$ followed by the isomorphism 
$\Omega^{1,hol}_{cl} (X) \cong \Vect_0(X)$ given by the holomorphic symplectic form. 

Extending this exact sequence to the level of Dolbeault resolutions, we see that we can view $F_0 \in \Omega^{0,1}(\CC^2 \setminus 0)$ as a $(0,1)$ Dolbeault valued divergence-free vector field $\til{F}_0$ on $\CC^2 \setminus 0$. 
Explicitly, if $F_0 = f^i (z,\zbar) \d \zbar_i$ then this $(0,1)$-valued vector field is
\[
\til{F}_0 = \ep_{jk} \partial_{z_j} f^i (z,\zbar) \d \zbar_i \partial_{z_k} .
\]

In the case at hand, $F \in \Omega^{0,1}(\CC^2 \setminus 0) \otimes \Omega^0(\RR)$ is given by the restriction along 
\[
(\CC^2 \setminus 0) \times \RR \to \CC^2 \setminus 0
\]
of the $(0,1)$-form
\[
F_0 = \# N \frac{\zbar_1 \d \zbar_2 - \zbar_2 \d \zbar_1}{\|z\|^4} .
\] 
The corresponding $(0,1)$-valued vector field on $\CC^2 \setminus 0$ is
\[
\til{F}_0 = \#' N \frac{\zbar_1 \d \zbar_2 - \zbar_2 \d \zbar_1}{\|z\|^6} \left(\zbar_1 \del_{z_2} - \zbar_2 \del_{z_1}\right) .
\] 

\appendix 

\section{An alternative description of the 11-dimensional theory} 
In \S \ref{s:dfn} we have described a family of BV theories on $X \times L$ where $X$ is an odd-dimensional Calabi--Yau manifold and $L$ is an odd-dimensional smooth manifold. 
The space of fields \eqref{eq:sympfields} is equipped with an odd symplectic pairing. 


There is a related, alternative description of this formal moduli space which is almost equivalent. 
Consider the resolution of holomorphic closed two-forms 
\beqn\label{eqn:twoform}
\Omega_{cl}^{2,hol}(X) \simeq \Omega^{2,\bu}(X) \xto{\del} \Omega^{3,\bu}(X)[-1] \to \cdots 
\eeqn
where we have left the $\dbar$-differential implicit, as always. 

There is a map from the two-term complex 
\[
\Omega^{0,\bu}(X)[1] \to \Omega^{1,\bu}(X)
\]
to the resolution \eqref{eqn:twoform} defined by the holomorphic de Rham operator $\del$. 
This map is almost a quasi-isomorphism of sheaves; it differs by copy of constant functions $\CC[1]$ in cohomological degree $-1$. 

Similarly, we can tensor with the dg algebra of de Rham forms on $L$ to obtain a map of $\ZZ/2$-graded cochain complexes
\[
\bigg(\Pi \Omega^{0,\bu}(X;L) \xto{\del} \Omega^{1,\bu}(X;L) \bigg) \xto{\del} \bigg(\Omega^{2,\bu}(X;L) \xto{\del} \Pi \Omega^{3,\bu}(X;L) \to \cdots \bigg) .
\]
Again, this map is a quasi-isomorphism up to a copy of $\Pi \CC$.
The left-hand side contains the fields $(\beta, \gamma)$. 
This map has the effect of sending $\beta \mapsto 0$ and $\gamma \mapsto \partial \gamma \in \Omega^{2,\bu}(X;L)$. 

The basic idea is to replace the complex where $(\beta,\gamma)$ live by this resolution of closed two-forms. 
The new space of fields is 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:poissfields} 
  \begin{tikzcd}[row sep = 1 ex]
     - & + & - & + \\ \hline
     \PV^{1,\bu}(X; L) \ar[r, "\div"] & \PV^{0,\bu}(X; L) \\
     & \Omega^{2,\bu}(X;L) \ar[r, "\del"] & \Omega^{3,\bu}(X;L) \ar[r] & \cdots 
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}

It may seem that this description of the fields of the 11-dimensional theory is not much different than the original formulation---at the level of the free theory they only differ by a copy of constant functions in odd cohomological degree. 
We'd like to point out two main differences:
\begin{itemize}
\item This new description does not have the structure of a BV theory in the usual sense; there is no odd symplectic pairing on the fields. 
Nevertheless, there is still an odd Poisson bracket acting on functionals of the fields which we will describe momentarily. 
For this reason, we will refer to the theory as a ``Poisson BV theory''. 
\item With the existence of the odd Poisson bracket one might be optimistic to formulate the CME for this Poisson BV theory.
However, there is no local interaction which is consistent with the local interaction present in the original BV theory. 
Nevertheless, the (shift of the) fields is equipped with an $L_\infty$ structure which is compatible with the odd Poisson bracket. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{prop}
The complex \eqref{eq:poissfields} is equipped with the structure of an interacting Poisson BV theory.
Let $\cG = \cG(X \times L)$ be the resulting $L_\infty$ algebra...
\end{prop}

Heuristically, we can write the action in the following non-local form
\[
\frac{1}{1-\nu} \mu^2 \eta + (\del^{-1} \eta) \eta^2 .
\]
\brian{are there more terms involving higher forms?}

The first few nonzero brackets are
\begin{align*}
[\mu]_1 & = \dbar \mu + \div \mu \\
[\eta]_1 & = \dbar \eta + \del \eta \\ 
[\mu_1,\mu_2]_2 & = \div (\mu_1 \wedge \mu_2) \\
[\mu, \eta]_2 & = \mu \vee \del \eta \\
[\eta_1,\eta_2]_2 & = \# \Omega^{-1} \vee (\eta_1 \wedge \eta_2)  \\
[\nu, \mu_1,\mu_2]_3 & = \div(\nu \mu_1 \mu_2) \\
[\nu, \mu,\eta]_3 & = \nu \mu \del \eta
\end{align*}
\brian{coefficients}
For $k \geq 2$ the general formula for the $k$-ary bracket is 
\begin{align*}
[\eta_1,\eta_2]_2 & = \# \Omega^{-1} \vee (\eta_1 \wedge \eta_2)  \\
[\nu_1,\nu_2, \ldots, \nu_{k-2}, \mu_1,\mu_2]_{k} & = \# \div(\nu_1 \cdots \nu_{k-2} \mu_1 \wedge \mu_2) \\ 
[\nu_1,\nu_2, \ldots, \nu_{k-2}, \mu,\eta]_{k} & = \# \nu_1 \cdots \nu_{k-2} (\mu \vee \del \eta) .
\end{align*}

There is a quasi-isomorphism of super $L_\infty$ algebras 
\[
E(5,10) \xto{\simeq} \cG(\CC^5 \times \RR) .
\]
This lifts to map of super $L_\infty$ algebras $E(5,10) \to \cL(\CC^5 \times \RR)$ whose kernel is $\CC$.

\ingmar{a section defining polyvector fields; not sure where this belong}
Equipped with this structure, the complex we have written maps in an obvious way into the complex of polyvector fields on~$X$. Recall that one defines
\deq{
  \PV^{i,j}(X) = \Omega^{0,j}(X, \wedge^i \T_X).
}
\ingmar{Wedges look super fucked up}
The complex $\PV^{\bu,\bu}$ is equipped with two natural differentials: the Dolbeault operator $\dbar$, of $(i,j)$-degree $(0,1)$, and the holomorphic divergence operator $\div$, which carries $(i,j)$-degree $(-1,0)$. Assigning total degree $- i + j$ to $\PV^{i,j}$ thus gives the total polyvector fields the structure of a bicomplex. We will use the shorthand notation $\PV^i = (\PV^{i,\bu}, \dbar )$ for the Dolbeault resolution of holomorphic $i$-polyvector fields. 

\subsubsection{}
It will be convenient for us to cast this dg Lie algebra in a slightly different way.
We construct a different model for the Lie algebra of divergence-free vector fields whose underlying cochain complex is the same as \eqref{eqn:cplx1}. 
The distinguishing feature is that this model is no longer a dg Lie algebra, but an $L_\infty$ algebra. 

The model we use is motivated by the topological string, specifically the description of the closed topological string in terms of Kodaira--Spencer theory \cite{BCOV}.
We recall the requisite background, but refer to \cite{CLbcov1,CLbcov2,CLtypeI} for more details. 

Suppose $X$ be a Calabi--Yau manifold of dimension $d$. 
Let $\PV^{k,\bu}(X)$ denote the Dolbeault complex of the holomorphic vector bundle $\wedge^k \T_X$; we will omit $X$ in this section and write $\PV^{k,\bu}$ for simplicity.
In particular, $\PV^{k,j}$ is the space of smooth sections of the bundle $\wedge^j \T_X^* \otimes \wedge^k \T_X$. 
With this notation, the dg Lie algebra in \eqref{eqn:cplx1} is $\PV^{1,\bu} \oplus \PV^{0,\bu}[-1]$ with differential $\dbar + \div$. 

Introduce a formal parameter $u$ of cohomological degree $+2$ and consider the complex 
\beqn\label{eqn:pv1}
\PV^{\bu,\bu} [[u]] [1]
\eeqn
with differential $\dbar + u \div$ which we will often denote just by $Q_{KS}$ and refer to as the linear BRST differential. 
With our conventions, notice that $u^l \PV^{k,j}$ sits in cohomological degree $2l +k + j - 1$. 

The Schouten--Nijenhuis bracket 
\[
[-,-] \colon \PV^{k,j} \times \PV^{p,q} \to \PV^{p+k-1,j+q} 
\]
extends $u$-linearly to endow \eqref{eqn:pv1} with the structure of a dg Lie algebra.
We refer to this as the Kodaira--Spencer, or strict, dg Lie algebra structure.
We refer to the further cohomological shift 
\[
\cE_{KS} = \PV^{\bu,\bu} [[u]] [2]
\]
as the space of fields of Kodaira--Spencer theory.

Notice that the complex resolving divergence-free vector fields \eqref{eqn:cplx1} sits inside $\cE_{KS} [-1]$ as a sub dg Lie algebra as $\PV^{1,\bu} \oplus u \PV^{0,\bu}[1]$. 

\subsubsection{}

\brian{bv bracket}

\subsubsection{}

Together with the linear BRST differential $Q_{KS}$, the bracket $\{-,-\}_{KS}$ induces the structure of a dg Lie algebra the cohomological shift of the space of local functionals $\oloc(\cE_{KS})[-2d+5]$. 

\begin{thm}[\cite{CLbcov1}]
The BCOV action 
\[
I_{BCOV} \in \oloc \left(\cE_{KS} \right) 
\]
satisfies the classical master equation 
\[
Q_{KS} I_{BCOV} + \frac12 \left\{I_{BCOV}, I_{BCOV}\right\}_{KS} = 0 .
\]
In other words, $I_{BCOV}$ determines a Maurer--Cartan element in the dg Lie algebra $\oloc(\cE_{KS})[-2d+5]$.
\end{thm}

This action induces the square-zero operator 
\[
\delta_{BCOV} = Q_{KS} + \{I_{BCOV}, -\} 
\]
acting on observables of the Kodaira--Spencer fields. 
In other words, it defines a non-linear BRST operator; in turn it
induces an $L_\infty$ structure $\{[-]_k\}_{k =1,2,3,\ldots}$ on the complex \eqref{eqn:pv1} whose linear operation is $[-]_1 = Q_{KS} = \dbar + u\div$. 

This $L_\infty$ structure is clearly not identical as the strict dg Lie algebra structure (it has operations of arbitrary high order). 
Nevertheless, it is equivalent to the strict dg Lie model: there is an $L_\infty$ automorphism which exchanges the two structures.

It is easiest to describe this automorphism at the level of observables.
Use the notation $\Sigma$ for a linear observable of the Kodaira--Spencer fields $\cE_{KS}$. 
Then, the Kodaira--Spencer dg Lie algebra structure induces the non-linear BRST operator $\delta_{KS}$ given by
\[
\delta_{KS} (\Sigma) = Q_{KS} \Sigma + \frac12 [\Sigma,\Sigma] .
\]

The non-linear change of coordinates relating the two structures is defined by
\[
\Psi \colon \Sigma \mapsto \left[u (e^{\Sigma/u} -1)\right]_+
\]
where $[-]_+$ projects onto the non-negative powers of $u$.  

\parsec[]

The complex resolving the (shift of) divergence-free vector fields 
\[
\left(\PV^{1,\bu}[1] \oplus u \PV^{0,\bu}[2] \, , \, \dbar + u \div\right) 
\]
is a subcomplex of $\cE_{KS}$.
If $d = \dim_\CC(X)=3$ then the shifted Poisson bivector $\Pi_{BCOV}$ restricts to a shifted Poisson bivector on this subcomplex. 
In particular, the action $I_{BCOV}$ restricts to a solution to the classical master equation for this subcomplex. 

If $d \ne 3$ then there is the following subcomplex $\til{\cE}_{KS}\subset \cE_{KS}$ defined by:
\beqn\label{eqn:tilks}
\begin{tikzcd}
\ul{-1} & \ul{0} & \cdots & \ul{d-4} & \ul{d-3} & \cdots    \\
\PV^{1,\bu} \ar[r] & u\PV^{0,\bu} & & & & &  \\
& & & \PV^{d-2, \bu} \ar[r] & u \PV^{d-3, \bu} \ar[r] & \cdots &   .
\end{tikzcd}
\eeqn
And one can check that the shifted Poisson bivector restricts to a shifted Poisson bivector on this subcomplex. 
Thus, we have the following.

\begin{prop}
\label{prop:tilbcov}
The BCOV action $I_{BCOV}$ restricts to a solution of the classical master equation on $\til{\cE}_{KS}$ that we denote by $\til{I}_{BCOV}$. 
\end{prop}

\subsubsection{}

Define the action by the group $\CC^\times$ on the complex $\til{\cE}_{KS}$ as follows.
Declare the first line in \eqref{eqn:tilks} is weight zero and the second line is weight $+1$. 
%Declare $\mu, \nu$ have $\CC^\times$ weight zero and $\beta,\gamma$ have $\CC^\times$ weight $+1$. 
The linear BRST operator is clearly weight zero and the shifted Poisson structure $\Pi_{KS}$ is of weight $+1$. 
Thus, the shifted Poisson bracket $\{-,-\}_{KS}$ is of $\CC^\times$ weight $+1$.

\begin{lem}
The restricted action $\til{I}_{BCOV}$ has $\CC^\times$ weight $-1$. 
In particular, the non-linear BRST operator 
\beqn\label{eqn:KSbrst}
\delta_{BCOV} = Q_{KS} + \{\til{I}_{BCOV},-\}_{KS}
\eeqn
is $\CC^\times$ weight zero.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
%The map $\Phi \colon \cE_{pot} \to \til{\cE}_{KS}$ preserves $\CC^\times$ weight, so it suffices to prove that $\til{I}_{BCOV}$ is weight $+1$. 
We will make use of two gradings on $\til{\cE}_{KS}$. 
The first is holomorphic polyvector field type, and the second is descendant degree.
The summand $u^l \PV^{k,\bu}$ is polyvector type $k$ and descendant degree $l$. 

We introduce notation in this proof that won't be used later on. 
Let $\alpha$ denote a super field living in the first line of \eqref{eqn:tilks} and let $\beta$ denote a super field living in the second line of \eqref{eqn:tilks}.
If a field of type $\alpha$ has polyvector type $k$ then it has descendant degree $1-k$, $k=0,1$. 
If a field of type $\beta$ has polyvector type $l$ then it has descendant degree $d-2-l$.

A homogenous polynomial degree term in the BCOV action $I_{BCOV}$ is a linear combination of functionals of the form
\[
 \alpha_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \alpha_m \wedge \beta_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \beta_n  .
\]
Let $k_i$ be the polyvector field type of $\alpha_i$ and let $l_j$ be the polyvector field type of $\beta_j$. 
In order for this expression to contribute nontrivially to the BCOV action two constraints must hold:
\begin{align*}
\sum_{i=1}^m k_i + \sum_{j=1}^n l_j & = d \\
\sum_{i=1}^m (1-k_i) + \sum_{j=1}^n (d-2-l_j) & = m+n-3 .
\end{align*}
The first constraint ensures that the integrand is of top polyvector degree. 
The second constraint is on the descendant degree, see \brian{ref above}. 

Simplifying these two equations, one finds the condition
\[
m+n-3 = m+(d-2)n - d 
\]
which implies $n=1$, as desired. 
\end{proof}

Consider the cochain complex $\left(\oloc(\til{\cE}_{KS}) \, , \, \delta_{KS} \right)$ of all local functionals equipped with the non-linear BRST differential \eqref{eqn:KSbrst}.  
The $\CC^\times$ weight zero subcomplex is 
\[
\big(\oloc(\til\cE_{KS})^{(0)} \, , \, \delta_{KS} \big) = \big(\oloc(\cE_0) \, , \, \delta_{KS} \big) 
\]
where $\cE_0 = \PV^{1,\bu}[1] \oplus u \PV^{0,\bu}$ is the subcomplex of the fields $\til\cE_{KS}$ comprising the first line of \eqref{eqn:tilks}.

\begin{prop}
\label{prop:Linfty}
The differential $\delta_{KS}$ acting on the weight zero fields induces a local $L_\infty$ algebra structure on the complex of vector bundles 
\[
\cE_0 [-1] = \PV^{1,\bu} \oplus \PV^{0,\bu}[-1]
\]
with $[-]_1 = \dbar + \div$. 
Furthermore, this $L_\infty$ algebra structure is equivalent to the strict dg Lie algebra structure on the resolution of divergence-free vector fields defined in \S \ref{sec:divfree}. 
\end{prop}

%Applying this to the $k$th exterior power of the holomorphic tangent bundle $V = \wedge^k \T_X$, we obtain a resolution of the sheaf of $k$-linear polyvector fields which we denote by $\PV^{k,\bu} (X) = \Omega^{0,\bu}(X, \wedge^k \T_X)$. 

%\subsubsection{}
%
%Consider the following cochain complex $\cE_{pot}$:
%\beqn\label{eqn:E}
%\begin{tikzcd}
%\ul{-1} & \ul{0} & \cdots & \ul{d-5} & \ul{d-4} &   \\

%& & & \Omega^{0, \bu} \ar[r,"\del"] & \Omega^{1, \bu} 
%\end{tikzcd}
%\eeqn
%We will refer to the components of the fields using the notation
