\begin{abstract}
We construct a fully interacting holomorphic/topological theory in eleven dimensions that is defined on products of Calabi--Yau fivefolds with real one-manifolds. 
The theory describes a particular deformation of the cotangent bundle to the moduli space of Calabi--Yau structures on the fivefold.
Its field content matches the holomorphic (or minimal) twist of the 
eleven-dimensional supergravity multiplet recently computed by the second two authors, and we offer numerous consistency checks showing that the interactions correctly describe interacting twisted eleven-dimensional supergravity at the perturbative level. 
We prove that the global symmetry algebra of our model on flat space is an $L_\infty$ central extension of the infinite-dimensional simple exceptional super Lie algebra $E(5,10)$, following a recent suggestion of Cederwall in the context of the relevant pure spinor model. 
Twists of superconformal algebras map to the fields of our model on the complement of a stack of M2 or M5 branes, laying the groundwork for a fully holomorphic version of twisted holography in this context.
