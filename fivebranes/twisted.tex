\section{Twisted eleven-dimensional supergravity}

\subsection{Observables in a holomorphic-topological theory}

\subsection{A model for twisted supergravity}

Let $X$ be a Calabi--Yau five-fold. 
In \cite{SWspinor} a complete description of the free limit of the holomorphic twist of eleven-dimensional supergravity is given. 
Within the BV formalism, the theory is only $\Z/2$ graded.

In \cite{RSW} we have given a proposal for the minimal twist of fully interacting eleven-dimensional supergravity as a $\Z/2$ graded interacting BV theory. 

\begin{thm}[\cite{RSW}]
On $X \times \R = \C^5 \times \R$ there is a quasi-isomorphism of the local observables of the minimal twist of eleven-dimensional supergravity 
\[
{\rm Ops}_{11d} \simeq \clie^\bu(\Hat{E}(5|10)) 
\]
\end{thm}

An explicit characterization of the holomorphic twist of a single fivebrane theory was given in \cite{SWtensor}. 
We briefly recall this desription.

The holomorphic twist of the fivebrane theory is defined on any complex three-fold $X$ (which is not necessarily Calabi--Yau).
To define the theory we must assume that $X$ is equipped with a square-root of the canonical bundle $K_X^{1/2}$. 

The theory is $\Z \times \Z/2$ graded but in this section we only need to recall its totalization as a $\Z/2$ graded theory. 
There are four fundamental fields $(\mu, \Omega, \phi_1,\phi_2)$ which consist of even Dolbeault forms of type $(2,1)$ and $(3,0)$ on $X$:
\[
\mu \in \Omega^{2,1}(X), \quad \Omega \in \Omega^{3,0}(X),
\]
and a pair of even sections:
\[
(\phi_1,\phi_2) \in \Omega^0(X , K^{1/2}_X) \otimes \C^2 .
\]
%where $R \cong \CC^2$ is the fundamental $Sp(1)$ representation. 
The equations of motion read
\beqn
\label{eqn:eom}
\begin{split}
\del \mu + \dbar \Omega & = 0 \\
\dbar \mu = \dbar \phi = \dbar \psi & = 0 .
\end{split}
\eeqn

There are gauge symmetries for the fields $\mu, \Omega$ determined by a ghost $b$ which is a Dolbeault form of type $(2,0)$ which acts simply by
\beqn
\label{eqn:ghost}
\begin{split}
\mu & \mapsto \mu + \dbar b  \\
\Omega & \mapsto \Omega + \del b .
\end{split}
\eeqn

This theory does not admit a Lagrangian description. 
However, it can still be put in a degenerate form of the BV formalism where the space of fields above is equipped with an odd Poisson bivector \cite{SWtensor}.
