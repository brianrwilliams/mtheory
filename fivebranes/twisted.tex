\section{Twisted eleven-dimensional supergravity}
%
\subsection{A model for minimally twisted supergravity}

In \cite{SWspinor} a complete description of the free limit of the holomorphic twist of eleven-dimensional supergravity is given.
Within the BV formalism, the theory is only $\Z/2$ graded.
In \cite{RSW} we have given a proposal for the minimal twist of fully interacting eleven-dimensional supergravity as a $\Z/2$ graded interacting BV theory in a background with global symmetry group $SU(5)$.
As such, the eleven-dimensional theory exists on any manifold of the form $X \times S$ where $X$ is a Calabi--Yau five-fold and $S$ is a real oriented smooth one-dimensional manifold.

In the first few sections we describe the fields and equations of motion of the eleven-dimensional theory.

%\]

\parsec[s:sugrafields]

To begin this section we highlight some of the important features of the eleven-dimensional model considered in \cite{RSW}. 
The theory utilizes the complex structure on the Calabi--Yau fivefold $X$.
We let $\T_X$ stand for the holomorphic tangent bundle of $X$ and $\Bar{\T}_X$ its complex conjugate.
Thus, the complexified tangent bundle of the eleven-manifold $S \times X$ decomposes as
\[
\T_S \oplus \T_X \oplus \Bar{\T}_X 
\]
where $\T_S$ is the complexified tangent bundle of the smooth one-manifold $S$.
Locally, we choose coordinates $(t;z,\zbar)$ where $t$ is a smooth coordinate for $S$ and $z$ is a holomorphic coordinate for $X$. 

Before giving a rigorous description of the fields and equations of motion, we focus on bosonic fields in our model which have an obvious analog in the untwisted theory. 
One of the primary fields of eleven-dimensional supergravity describes deformations of the metric $g$.
Since we work in a background which has $SU(5)$ holonomy we can take the background metric on $S \times X$ to be the product of the flat metric on $S$ with a Calabi--Yau metric $g_{CY}$ on $X$. 

Deformations of the background metric which survive the twist can be identified with Beltrami differentials, that is, sections of 
\[
\Bar{\T}_X^* \otimes \T_X \cong \Bar{\T}^*_X \otimes \Bar{\T}_X^* 
\]
which we will denote by $\mu$. 
In local holomorphic coordinates $\mu$ admits a description like
\[
\mu = \mu^{\Bar{i}}_j (t;z,\zbar) \d \zbar_{\Bar{i}} \otimes \del_{z_i} .
\]

One of the other bosonic fields of eleven-dimensional supergravity is a three-form which is usually denoted by~$C$. 
On $S \times X$ the space of complex-valued three-forms decomposes into de Rham--Dolbeault forms as in
\[
\oplus_{k+p+q=3} \Omega^k(S) \otimes \Omega^{p,q}(X) .
\]
We denote the homogenous pieces as the space of $(k;p,q)$ forms, these admit local presentations as
\[
\sum_{P,Q} f_{PQ} (t;z,\zbar) \d z_P \d \zbar_Q + \sum_{P',Q'} g_{P'Q'}(t;z,\zbar) \d t \d z_{P'}\d \zbar_{Q'} 
\]
where the first sum is over tuples $P=(p_1,p_2,p_3),Q=(q_1,q_2,q_3)$ such that $\sum_i (p_i + q_i) = 3$, $0 \leq p_i,q_i \leq 3$.
The second sum is over tuples $P',Q'$ such that $\sum_i (p_i'+q_i') = 2$. 

In the minimal twist only forms with $p_i ,p_i'\leq 1$ survive. 
Thus, the components of the three-form which survive live in
\[
\left(\oplus_{k+q = 3} \Omega^k(S) \otimes \Omega^{0,q}(X)\right) \oplus 
\left(\oplus_{k+q = 2} \Omega^k(S) \otimes \Omega^{1,q}(X)\right) .
\]
We denote a general (non-homogenous) element in the first summand by $\beta$ and an element in the second summand by $\gamma$.
When we want to be specific by the form type we use the notation $\beta^{k;q}$ for the $(k;0,q)$ component of the three-form and $\gamma^{k;q}$ for the $(k;1,q)$ component of the three-form.

\parsec[s:Lsugra]

We move on to give a complete description of our eleven-dimensional model within the Batalin--Vilkovisky (BV) formalism.
This amounts to introducing antifields and antighosts to the fields and ghosts that we have just described.
One of the key structures is the graded skew-symmetric pairing between fields and antifields (ghosts and antighosts).
Once such a pairing $\omega_{BV}$ is introduced, one can opt to describe solutions to the equations of motion as Maurer--Cartan elements of a certain sheaf of ($\Z/2$-graded) $L_\infty$ algebras on $X \times S$.

An $L_\infty$ algebra is a graded vector space~$L=\oplus_{p\in \Z} L^p$ equipped with a collection of operations $\{[-]_k\}_{k = 1,2,\ldots}$ where 
\[
[-]_k \colon L^{\times k} \to L[2-k] 
\]
are multilinear maps which satisfy the ordinary higher Jacobi relations defining an $L_\infty$ algebra \cite{??}. 
The shift $[2-k]$ means that $[-]_k$ is of cohomological degree $k-2$. 

The BV fields arise as the sections of a sheaf of $L_\infty$ algebras $\cL$ over the spacetime manifold $M$.
There is an overall shift in the relationship between the cohomological grading of $\cL$ and the ghost number in physics terminology. 
In cohomological degree zero sit the ghosts, in cohomological degree zero sit the fields, etc..
In this sense it is more accurate to refer to the BV fields as sections of the shift of the sheaf of $L_\infty$ algebras $\cL[1]$. 
Together with the skew symmetric pairing $\omega_{BV}$ on the fields structure maps $[-]_k$ organize together to define the full BV action which takes the general form
\[
S(\Phi) = \sum_{k \geq 1} \omega_{BV} \left(\Phi , [\Phi,\ldots,\Phi]_{k}\right) .
\]

One feature of our proposal for the minimal twist of eleven-dimensional supergravity is that it only carries an overall $\Z/2$ grading. 
This $\Z/2$ grading totalizes the original ghost grading (which is by the group $\Z$) and the fermion number which is present in the untwisted theory.
We thus make use of $\Z/2$ graded versions of the usual BV formalism.
In this paper $\Z/2$ graded $L_\infty$ algebra means that we just have a $\Z/2$ graded vector space.
There are operations $\{[-]_k\}_{k = 1,2,\ldots}$ which satisfy the same higher Jacobi identities.
The operation $[-]_k$ is even if $k$ is even and odd if $k$ is odd.\footnote{This is not to be confused with a super $L_\infty$ algebra which is an $L_\infty$ algebra internal to the category of super vector spaces.
A $\Z/2$ graded $L_\infty$ algebra is simply what one gets when they apply the forgetful function from $\Z$ graded vector spaces to $\Z/2$ graded vector spaces.}

We introduce a sheaf of $\Z/2$ graded $L_\infty$ algebras on the Calabi--Yau five-fold $X$.
As a sheaf of super vector spaces, it will be given as the holomorphic sections of a super vector bundle that we denote by $L_X$. 
The even part of this super vector bundle is
\[
\T_X \oplus \C_X 
\]
where $\T_X$ is the holomorphic tangent bundle and $\C_X$ is the trivial bundle.
We will denote even sections by $(\mu, \beta)$ according to the decomposition. 
The odd part is 
\[
\C_X \oplus \T^*_X .
\]
We will denote odd elements by $(\nu, \gamma)$ according to the decomposition. 

The $L_\infty$ structure on the sheaf of holomorphic sections of $L_X$ is described as follows. 
First, $\d = [-]_1$, the differential, is simply given by 
\begin{align*}
\d \beta & = \del \beta \in \Omega^1_X \subset L_{X,-} \\
\d \mu & = \div \mu \in \cO_X \subset L_{X, -}
\end{align*}
and $\d \gamma = \d \nu = 0$. 
For $k \geq 2$ the general formula for the $k$-ary brackets is 
\begin{align*}
[\nu_1, \ldots, \nu_{k-2}, \mu_1,\mu_2]_{k} & = \div(\nu_1 \cdots \nu_k \mu_1 \wedge \mu_2) \\
[\nu_1,\ldots, \nu_{k-3}, \mu_1,\mu_2,\gamma]_k & = \nu_1 \cdots \nu_{k-3} (\mu \wedge \mu') \vee \del \gamma .\\
[\nu_1,\ldots,\nu_{k-2}, \mu, \gamma]_k & = \nu_1 \cdots \nu_{k-2} \mu \vee \del \gamma .
\end{align*}
In \cite{RSW} it is shown that this endows $L_{X}$ with the structure of a sheaf of $\Z/2$ graded $L_\infty$ algebras.
There is a sub sheaf given by the sections $\mu$ and $\nu$ which is $L_\infty$-equivalent to the sheaf of holomorphic divergence-free vector fields on $X$. 

As all operations above are given in terms of holomorphic polydifferential operators, the $L_\infty$ algebra structure above induces a $\Z/2$ graded $L_\infty$ algebra structure on the Dolbeault resolution $\Omega^{0,\bu}(X,L_X)$ of the holomorphic vector bundle $L_X$.

Finally, to obtain a local $L_\infty$ algebra on $X \times S$, where $S$ denotes an arbitrary real oriented smooth one-manifold, we simply tensor with the de Rham complex along~$S$.
We denote by $\cL_{sugra}$ the following local $\Z/2$ graded $L_\infty$ algebra on $X \times S$
\beqn
\cL_{sugra} \define \Omega^\bu(S) \hotimes \Omega^{0,\bu}(X,L_X) .
\eeqn

\parsec[s:rsw]
It is shown in \cite{RSW} that $\cL_{sugra}$ is equipped with a non-degenerate odd pairing which is compatible with the $L_\infty$ structure above. 
All together, this data prescribes the structure of a $\Z/2$ graded theory in the BV formalism. 
On $X \times S = \C^5 \times \R$ it is furthermore argued in \cite{RSW} that this BV theory is equivalent to the holomorphic (or minimal) twist of perturbative eleven-dimensional supergravity. 


\subsection{Twisted fivebranes} 

%\subsection{Twisted AdS backgrounds}

Six-dimensional $\cN=(2,0)$ supersymmetry admits two inequivalent classes of twists characterized by the number of directions which are left invariant:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
The holomorphic, or minimal, twist. 
This twist leaves three real directions invariant. 
The holomorphic twist of any $\cN=(2,0)$ theory can be defined on any complex three-fold $Z$ equipped with a square-root of its canonical bundle. 
\item 
The non-minimal twist. 
This twist leaves five real directions invariant.
The non-minimal twist of any $\cN=(2,0)$ theory can be defined on a six-manifold of the form $M^4 \times \Sigma$ where $M^4$ is a smooth four-manifold and $\Sigma$ is a Riemann surface. 
\end{itemize}

By standard arguments, the theory on a stack of $N$ fivebranes in flat space is a theory with $\cN=(2,0)$ supersymmetry. 
In later sections we provide arguments using the technology of twisted holography developed by Costello, Gaiotto, Li, and Paquette \cite{??} to provide a conjectural description of the twist of the theory for general $N > 1$. 
An explicit characterization of the holomorphic and non-minimal twists of a single fivebrane theory has been given in \cite{SWtensor}. 
We briefly recall this description. 

\parsec[s:single]

The holomorphic twist of the fivebrane theory is defined on any complex three-fold $Z$ (which is not necessarily equipped with a Calabi--Yau structure).
In the particular twist we will use we must assume, however, that $Z$ is equipped with a square-root of the canonical bundle $K_Z^{1/2}$. 

The theory is $\Z \times \Z/2$ graded where $\Z$ is the ghost number (or cohomological degree) and $\Z/2$ is parity. 
There are four fundamental fields of ghost number zero $(\alpha, \omega, \phi_1,\phi_2)$ which consist of even Dolbeault forms of type $(2,1)$ and $(3,0)$ on $Z$:
\[
\alpha \in \Omega^{2,1}(Z), \quad \omega \in \Omega^{3,0}(Z),
\]
and a pair of odd $(0,1)$ forms twisted by the line bundle $K^{1/2}_Z$:
\[
(\phi_1,\phi_2) \in \Pi \Omega^{0,1}(Z , K^{1/2}_Z) \otimes \C^2 .
\]
%where $R \cong \CC^2$ is the fundamental $Sp(1)$ representation. 
The equations of motion read
\beqn
\label{eqn:eom}
\begin{split}
\del \alpha + \dbar \omega & = 0 \\
\dbar \alpha = \dbar \phi_i & = 0 .
\end{split}
\eeqn

There are gauge symmetries for the fields $\mu, \Omega$ determined by a ghost $b$ which is a Dolbeault form of type $(2,0)$ which acts simply by
\beqn
\label{eqn:ghost}
\begin{split}
\mu & \mapsto \mu + \dbar b  \\
\Omega & \mapsto \Omega + \del b .
\end{split}
\eeqn
There are also odd gauge symmetries for the odd fields $\phi_i$ given by
\beqn
\phi_i \mapsto \phi_i + \dbar \chi 
\eeqn
where $\chi \in \Omega^0(Z, K_{Z}^{1/2}) \otimes \C^2$. 

This theory notoriously does not admit a Lagrangian description. 
However, it can still be put in a degenerate form of the BV formalism where the space of fields above is equipped with an odd Poisson bivector \cite{SWtensor}.
We describe this Poisson bivector explicitly

In the (degenerate) BV formalism, this free theory can be packaged into the data of an abelian $\Z \times \Z/2$ graded local Lie algebra on $Z$ which is of the form 
\[
\cL_{single} = \Omega^{\geq 2, \bu}(Z) \oplus \Pi \Omega^{0,\bu}(Z, K^{1/2}_Z) \otimes \C^2 .
\]
The full space of BV fields is simply $\Pi \cL_{single}$.

\subsection{Twisted Membranes}
\surya{add}

\subsection{Twisted Backreactions}

In eleven-dimensional supergravity, the ${\rm AdS}_7 \times S^4$ and ${\rm AdS}_{4}\times S^{7}$ backgrounds are obtained by backreacting a number of fivebranes and membranes respectively in flat space \brian{references}.

In \cite{RSW} we gave descriptions of twisted versions of these backgrounds. We recall this construction, adapted to a slightly more global situation. We will consider the eleven-dimensional theory on 11-manifolds that arise as total spaces of vector bundles. Placing the theory in the backreacted geometry is a 3-step procedure:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Place the eleven dimensional theory on the complement of the zero section. To do so, we will wish to describe the complement of the zero-section in a way that facilitates natural operations on holomorphic-topological local $L_{\infty}$-algebras.

  \item Deform the theory on the complement of the zero section by a certain maurer-cartan element. The Maurer-Cartan element is thought of as the flux sourced by branes wrapping the zero section.

  \item The complement of the zero section is a manifold with boundary - we impose a natural boundary condition.

\end{itemize}

\parsec

As above, let $Z$ be a three-fold, $V\to Z$ a rank 2 holomorphic vector bundle such that $\wedge^{2} V \cong K_{Z}$, and let $X = {\rm Tot}V$. The condition on $V$ ensures that $X$ is a Calabi-Yau five-fold - in the main body of the paper we will restrict ourselves to $V = K_{Z}^{1/2}\otimes \C^{2}$. We will view $\R\times X = {\rm Tot}(\R\oplus V)$, and consider a stack of N fivebranes wrapping the zero section in $\R\oplus V$.

We begin by describing the complement of the zero section
\[
M = \R\oplus V \setminus 0\times Z.
\]

Note that $\R \times X$ is equipped with a natural transverseley-holomorphic foliation - the complexified tangent bundle decomposes as $T_{\R}\oplus T_{Z}\oplus \bar T_{Z}$. Accordingly, we may choose as fiber coordinates $t, w_{1}, w_{2}, \bar w_{1}, \bar w_{2}$ and a fiberwise partially hermitian metric $h$. Explicitly, the corresponding norm is given by
\begin{align*}
 \pi:  \R\times X & \to \R_{+} \\
  (t, w_{i}, \bar{w_{i}}, p)& \mapsto t^{2} + |w_{1}|^{2}+|w_{2}|^{2}
\end{align*}
Letting $p : \R\times X \to Z$, we have an $S^{4}$-bundle $(\pi, p) : \R\times X - Z \to \R_{>0}\times Z$. Let $V_{M}$ denote the vertical tangent bundle to $(\pi, p)$, which we view as a subbundle of the real tangent bundle $T_{M}$. The complexification $V_{M}^{\C}$ inherits some natural subbundles coming from the ambient THF structure. Indeed, letting $\iota : M \to \R\times X$ denote the standard inclusion, we may consider the pair
\[
  V_{M}\cap \iota^{*} T_{\R}, \ \ \ \ \ V\cap \iota^{*} T_{Z}.
\]

The fibers of the composition $V_{M}\to M\to \R_{+}\times Z$ are copies of the tangent bundle of $S^{4}$, and the corresponding fibers of $V_{M}$ are subbundles of $TS^{4}$ that equip the fiber 4-spheres with a generalized Cauchy-Riemann structure. \surya{CITE}

We wish to describe the pushforward $(\pi, p)_{*}\cL_{sugra}$. The underlying sheaf of cochain complexes is given by

\[
\Omega^{\bullet}(\R_{+})\otimes \left ( \begin{tikzcd}
\ul{\rm even} & \ul{\rm odd} \\
\PV^{1,\bu}(Z) \ar[r, "\del_{\Omega}"] & \PV^{0,\bu}(Z)\\
\Omega^{0,\bu}(Z) & \Omega^{1,\bu}(Z) \ar[l, "\del"]
\end{tikzcd}
 \right ) \otimes CR (S^{4}).
\]


Here $CR (S^{4})$ denotes the cohomology of the tangential Cauchy-Riemann complex of $S^{4}$ \surya{CITE}, equipped with the above Cauchy-Riemann structure. Its computation is facilitated by the following lemma:

\begin{lem}
  Let $\R^{d}\times \C^{n}$ be an affine THF manifold, and choose a partial hermitian metric. Let $S^{d+2n-1}$ denote the corresponding unit sphere, equipped with its standard generalized Cauchy-Riemann structure. Then there is a quasi-isomorphism

  \[CR (S^{n+2d-1})\cong \cA^{\bu;\bu}\left ( (\R^{d}\times \C^{n})\setminus 0 \right )\]

  where the right-hand-side denotes the Dolbeault-deRham complex.
\end{lem}

The cohomology of the Dolbeault-deRham complex of $\R\times \C^{2}$ is easy to describe.


It was argued in \cite{RSW} that to leading order the coupling of a stack of twisted fivebranes to the eleven-dimensional theory is given by the nonlocal interaction 
\beqn\label{eqn:br1}
I_{M5} = N\int_{Z} \div^{-1}\mu \vee \Omega +\cdots 
\eeqn
where $\mu \in \Omega^0 (\R) \hotimes \PV^{1,3}(X)$ is a component of a field in the eleven-dimensional theory which satisfies $\div \mu = 0$.

\parsec
Let $C$ be a curve, and let $V\to C$ be a rank 4-holomorphic vector bundle over $C$ such that $\wedge^{4} V = K_{C}$. This condition again ensures that $X = {\rm Tot} V$ is a Calabi-Yau five-fold - in the main body of the paper, we will take $V = K^{1/2}_{C}\otimes \C^{4}$. Abusively letting $V$ also denote its pullback along the canonical projection $\R\times C \to C$, we may view $\R\times X$ as the total space of $V$ on $\R\times C$. As before we will consider wrapping a stack of $N$ membranes along the zero section.

Since $V$ is a complex vector bundle, we may choose a fiberwise hermitian metric, and as before, we may view $\R\times X \setminus \R\times C$ as an $S^{7}$-bundle over $\R_{>0}\times \R\times C$.




\subsection{Supergravity at the boundary of AdS}

Suppose we are in the situation in the last section where we place the eleven-dimensional theory on $\R \times X$ where $X = {\rm Tot}(K^{1/2}_Z \otimes \C^2)$. 
We are furthermore placing some number of fivebranes along the locus $Z$ cut out by the zero section. 
If we remove this locus we obtain the following manifold 
\[
\R \times X - \left(0 \times Z\right) \simeq Z \times \left({\rm Tot}(N_Z) - 0\right) 
\]
where on the right hand side ${\rm Tot}(N_Z) - 0$ is the total space of the normal bundle to $Z$ in $\R \times X$ minus the zero section.


\subsection{Enhanced symmetry in a flat background}

\parsec[s:e36]

We recall the definition of the exceptional super Lie algebra $E(3|6)$. 
We follow \cite{Kac_class, KacRudakov}.

The even part of the super Lie algebra $E(3|6)$ is 
\[
\Vect(\Hat{D}^3) \oplus \lie{sl}(2) \otimes \cO(\Hat{D}^3) .
\]
The Lie bracket is determined by the obvious commutators and the action of vector fields on functions. 

The odd part is of the form
\[
\Omega^{-1/2}(\Hat{D}^3) \otimes \C^2 .
\]
where $\Omega^{-1/2}(\Hat{D}^3)$ is the space of formal power series sections of the bundle
\[
\T_{\Hat{D}^3}^{*} \otimes K_{\Hat{D}^3}^{-1/2}
\]
where $K_{\Hat{D}^3}^{-1/2}$ is the negative square-root of the canonical bundle on $\Hat{D}^3$. 
We will write a general element of this module as 
\[
\alpha = \sum_i g^i \d z_i^{-1/2} 
\]
where $g^i \in \cO(\Hat{D}^3)$. 
The action by the even part of the super Lie algebra is by Lie derivative and by the fundamental $\lie{sl}(2)$ action on $\C^2$.
We will write $r \in \C^2$ for a vector in the fundamental representation.
Finally, there is a bracket 
\[
E(3|6)_- \times E(3|6)_- \to E(3|6)_+
\]
defined by
\[
[\alpha_1 \otimes r_1, \alpha_2 \otimes r_2] = - (\alpha_1 \wedge \alpha_2) \otimes (r_1 \wedge r_2) - (\d \alpha_1 \otimes \alpha_2 + \alpha_1 \otimes \d \alpha_2) \otimes (r_1 \odot r_2) .
\]
%The first term in the above equation arises from the composition 
%\[
%(\Hat{\Omega}_3^{-1/2} \otimes \Hat{\Omega}_3^{-1/2}) \otimes (R \otimes R) \xto{\wedge \otimes \wedge} \Hat{\Omega}_3^{-1} \otimes \wedge^2 R \cong \fw_3 .
%\] 
%The second term uses the composition 
%\[
%(\Hat{\Omega}_3^{-1/2} \otimes \Hat{\Omega}_3^{-1/2}) \otimes (R \otimes R) \xto{(\d \otimes \id) \otimes \odot} (\Hat{\Omega}_3^{1/2} \otimes \Hat{\Omega}_3^{-1/2}) \otimes \Sym^2 (R) \cong \lie{sl}(2) \otimes \Hat{\cO}_3 . 
%\]

\parsec[s:weight]


\parsec[s:locallieE510]

We have recollected how the super Lie algebra $E(5|10)$ (and its central extension) decomposes as a module for the super Lie algebra $E(3|6)$. 
We now wish to lift this to a decomposition of factorization algebras on $\C^3$, or more generally, factorization algebras on any complex three-fold $Z$. 

We outline an approach to constructing the factorization algebras via enveloping factorization algebras of certain (infinite rank) local Lie algebras on the three-fold $X$. 
For another approach \brian{pointer}. 

We have already discussed the local Lie algebra $\cL_{sugra}$ on $X \times S$ where $X$ is a Calabi--Yau five-fold and $S$ is a smooth one-manifold. 
We take $X = Z \times \C^2$ and $S = \R$. 
and view $\Obs_{sugra} = \clie^\bu(\cL_{sugra})$ as a factorization algebra on $Z \times \C^2 \times \R$. 
Then, we can consider the pushforward of $\Obs_{sugra}$ along the map
\[
\pi \colon Z \times \C^2 \times \R \to Z 
\]
which leads to a factorization algebra $\pi_* \Obs_{sugra}$ on the three-fold $Z$. 

Since $\pi$ is not a proper map (the fibers are not compact) we cannot exhibit $\pi_*\Obs_{sugra}$ as the Chevalley--Eilenberg complex of some ordinary local Lie algebra on $Z$. 
Nevertheless we will find a pro local Lie algebra $\cL_{sugra,\pi}$ on $Z$ which is a particularly nice `small model' for this pushforward factorization algebra.

A local Lie algebra enhancement for $E(3|6)$ has been given in \cite{SWsuca6d} \brian{finish}







\section{Example} 

Consider the holomorphic local Lie algebra on $\C^n$
\[
\Omega^{0,\bu}(\C^n) 
\]
and corresponding factorization algebra $\cF = \clie^\bu(\Omega^{0,\bu}(\C^n))$. 
Now, we can restrict this to a factorization algebra on
\[
\C^n - 0 \subset \C^n
\]
that we denote by $\cF|_{\C^n - 0}$. 

Next, consider the radial projection
\[
r \colon \C^n - 0 \to \R .
\]
Notice that $r_* (\cF|_{\C^n - 0})$ will not be the observables of any ordinary local Lie algebra.
Nevertheless we can come up with a nice algebraic model.  

Let $A_n$ be the usual dg model for the formal punctured disk $\Hat{D}^n - 0$ as defined in \cite{FHK,GWkm}.

\begin{lem}
There is an injective map of factorization algebras on $\RR_{>0}$:
\[
\clie^\bu(\Omega^\bu(\RR_{>0}) \otimes A_n) \to r_* (\cF|_{\C^n - 0}) 
\]
which is dense in cohomology.
\end{lem}

This tells us that the correct `fields' of the dimensionally reduced theory on $\RR_{>0}$ is $\Omega^\bu(\R_{>0}) \otimes A_n$.
