\section{Twisted eleven-dimensional supergravity}

\subsection{Observables in a holomorphic-topological theory}

One of the main results of \cite{CG2}.

\begin{dfn} 
Let $\Obs$ be a factorization algebra on a smooth manifold $M$.
The classical \defterm{point observables} at $p \in M$ is the limit $\Obs(p) = \lim_{U \ni p} \Obs(U)$ where the limit runs over open sets $U \subset M$ containing $p$.
\end{dfn}

\parsec

Without loss of generality we will assume our holomorphic-topological local Lie algebra on $M \times X$ is of the form
\[
\cL = \Omega^\bu (M) \hotimes \Omega^{0,\bu}(X, L) 
\]
where $L$ is a graded holomorphic vector bundle on $X$.

\begin{lem}
\label{lem:localops}
Suppose that $\cL$ is a holomorphic-topological local Lie algebra on $\R^m \times \C^n$ and consider the factorization algebra $\Obs = \clie^\bu (\cL)$. 
Then, the Taylor expansion map
\[
\cL(\C^n \times \R^m) \to L_0[[z_0,\ldots,z_n]]
\]
induces a quasi-isomorphism of commutative dg algebras
\[
\Obs(0) \simeq \clie^\bu \left( L_0[[z_1,\ldots,z_n]] \right) .
\]
\end{lem}

 
\subsection{A model for twisted supergravity}

Let $X$ be a Calabi--Yau five-fold. 
In \cite{SWspinor} a complete description of the free limit of the holomorphic twist of eleven-dimensional supergravity is given. 
Within the BV formalism, the theory is only $\Z/2$ graded.

In \cite{RSW} we have given a proposal for the minimal twist of fully interacting eleven-dimensional supergravity as a $\Z/2$ graded interacting BV theory. 

\parsec[s:fields]
The eleven-dimensional theory exists on any manifold of the form $X \times S$ where $X$ is a Calabi--Yau five-fold and $S$ is a real oriented smooth one-dimensional manifold. 

\parsec[s:e510]

Let $\Hat{D}^5$ denote the formal five-disk whose algebra of functions is 
\[
\cO(\Hat{D}^5) = \C[[z_1,\ldots,z_5]] .
\]

\parsec[s:L0]

For us, a $\Z/2$ graded $L_\infty$ algebra is a $\Z/2$ graded vector space $L$ equipped with a collection of operations $\{[-]_k\}_{k = 1,2,\ldots}$ where 
\[
\ell_k \colon L^{\times k} \to \Pi^k L 
\]
are multilinear maps which satisfy the ordinary higher Jacobi relations defining an $L_\infty$ algebra \cite{??}. 
Here, $\Pi^k L = L$ if $k$ is even and $\Pi^k L = \Pi L$ if $k$ is odd. 
Thus, $\ell_k$ is an even operation if $k$ is even and an odd operation if $k$ is odd. 
\footnote{This is not to be confused with a super $L_\infty$ algebra which is an $L_\infty$ algebra internal to the category of super vector spaces.
A $\Z/2$ graded $L_\infty$ algebra is simply what one gets when they apply the forgetful function from $\Z$ graded vector spaces to $\Z/2$ graded vector spaces.}

Let $L_{sugra}$ be the following $\Z/2$ graded $L_\infty$ algebra. 
The even part is 
\[
\Vect (\Hat{D}^5) \oplus \cO (\Hat{D}^5) .
\]
We will denote even elements by $(\mu, \beta)$ according to the decomposition. 
The odd part is 
\[
\cO(\Hat{D}^5) \oplus \Omega^1(\Hat{D}^5) .
\]
We will denote odd elements by $(\nu, \gamma)$ according to the decomposition. 

The $L_\infty$ structure is described as follows. 
First, $\d = [-]_1$, the differential, is simply given by 
\begin{align*}
\d \beta & = \del \beta \in \Omega^1(\Hat{D}^5) \subset L_{sugra,-} \\
\d \mu & = \div \mu \in \cO(\Hat{D}^5) \subset L_{sugra, -}
\end{align*}
and $\d \gamma = \d \nu = 0$. 

For $k \geq 2$ the general formula for the $k$-ary brackets is 
\begin{align*}
[\nu_1, \ldots, \nu_{k-2}, \mu_1,\mu_2]_{k} & = \div(\nu_1 \cdots \nu_k \mu_1 \wedge \mu_2) \\
[\nu_1,\ldots, \nu_{k-3}, \mu_1,\mu_2,\gamma]_k & = \nu_1 \cdots \nu_{k-3} (\mu \wedge \mu') \vee \del \gamma .\\
[\nu_1,\ldots,\nu_{k-2}, \mu, \gamma]_k & = \nu_1 \cdots \nu_{k-2} \mu \vee \del \gamma .
\end{align*}
In \cite{RSW} it is shown that this endows $L_{sugra}$ with the structure of a $\Z/2$ graded $L_\infty$ algebra.

\parsec[s:sugraobs]

By the usual methods of the BV formalism the action functional $S_{sugra}$ described above endows the parity shift of the fields $\cL_{sugra} = \Pi \cF_{sugra}$ with the structure of a holomorphic-topological local $\Z/2$ graded $L_\infty$ algebra. 

On $\C^5 \times \R$ we can describe this super Lie algebra structure explicitly. 
First, by the Dolbeault and de Rham Poincar\'e lemmas it is easy that the even part of the super Lie algebra $\cL(\C^5 \times \R)$ is equivalent to a one-dimensional central summand $\C$ plus the Lie algebra of divergence-free vector fields on $\C^5$:
\[
\Vect_0 (\C^5) = \{X \in \Vect(\C^5) \; | \; \div X = 0\} .
\]
The odd part of the super Lie algebra $\cL(\C^5 \times \R)$ is equivalent to the space of holomorphic one-forms on $\C^5$ modulo exact one-forms
\[
\Omega^{1,hol}(\C^5) / {\rm Im}(\del) 
\]
which is, of course, equivalent to the space of closed holomorphic two-forms $\Omega^{2,hol}_{cl}(\C^5)$. 

\begin{thm}[\cite{RSW}[Theorem 2.1]]
The Taylor expansion map determines a map of $\Z/2$ graded $L_\infty$ algebras
\[
j_\infty \colon \cL_{sugra}(\C^5 \times \R) \to L_{sugra} .
\]
Furthermore, $L_{sugra}$ is equivalent as a $\Z/2$ graded $L_\infty$ algebra to $\Hat{E(5|10)}$. 
\end{thm} 

As an immediate corollary of this result we obtain by Lemma \ref{lem:localops} the following.

\begin{cor}
\label{cor:sugraops}
Let $\Obs_{sugra}$ be the factorization algebra on $\C^5 \times \R$ of classical observables of the minimal twist of eleven-dimensional supergravity.
There is a quasi-isomorphism of commutative dg algebras
\[
\Obs_{sugra} (0) \simeq \clie^\bu \left( \Hat{E(5|10)} \right) .
\]
\end{cor}


\subsection{Twisted fivebranes} 

%\subsection{Twisted AdS backgrounds}

\parsec[s:coupling]

\parsec[s:single]

An explicit characterization of the holomorphic twist of a single fivebrane theory was given in \cite{SWtensor}. 
We briefly recall this desription. 

\parsec[]

The holomorphic twist of the fivebrane theory is defined on any complex three-fold $X$ (which is not necessarily Calabi--Yau).
To define the theory we must assume that $X$ is equipped with a square-root of the canonical bundle $K_X^{1/2}$. 

The theory is $\Z \times \Z/2$ graded but at first pass we recall its totalization as a $\Z/2$ graded theory. 
There are four fundamental fields $(\mu, \Omega, \phi_1,\phi_2)$ which consist of even Dolbeault forms of type $(2,1)$ and $(3,0)$ on $X$:
\[
\mu \in \Omega^{2,1}(X), \quad \Omega \in \Omega^{3,0}(X),
\]
and a pair of even sections:
\[
(\phi_1,\phi_2) \in \Omega^0(X , K^{1/2}_X) \otimes \C^2 .
\]
%where $R \cong \CC^2$ is the fundamental $Sp(1)$ representation. 
The equations of motion read
\beqn
\label{eqn:eom}
\begin{split}
\del \mu + \dbar \Omega & = 0 \\
\dbar \mu = \dbar \phi = \dbar \psi & = 0 .
\end{split}
\eeqn

There are gauge symmetries for the fields $\mu, \Omega$ determined by a ghost $b$ which is a Dolbeault form of type $(2,0)$ which acts simply by
\beqn
\label{eqn:ghost}
\begin{split}
\mu & \mapsto \mu + \dbar b  \\
\Omega & \mapsto \Omega + \del b .
\end{split}
\eeqn

This theory notoriously does not admit a Lagrangian description. 
However, it can still be put in a degenerate form of the BV formalism where the space of fields above is equipped with an odd Poisson bivector \cite{SWtensor}.
We describe this Poisson bivector explicitly  

\parsec[s:zz2]

In the BV formalism the fields of a free theory together with the ghosts and the (partial) antifields combine to form a cochain complex. 

\parsec[s:singleops]

\begin{prop}
Let $\Obs_{fivebrane}$ be the observables of the theory on a single fivebrane on $\C^3$ after performing the holomorphic twist.
There is a quasi-isomorphism of super commutative dg algebras 
\[
\Obs_{fivebrane} (0) \simeq \Sym \left( I(0,0;1;-1)^* \right) .
\]
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
This follows from Lemma \ref{lem:localops}.
In \cite{SWsuca6d} a dg lift of Kac's module $I(0,0;1;-1)$ was defined with the following bigraded pieces:
\beqn
\text{bidegree} (-1,+)\colon \quad \Hat{\Omega}_3^{2} , \qquad \text{bidegree} (0,+)\colon \quad \Hat{\Omega}^{3}_3
\eeqn
and
\beqn
\text{bidegree} (-1, -)\colon \quad \Hat{\Omega}^{3/2}_{3} \otimes R .
\eeqn
The differential is the (algebraic) de Rham differential $\del \colon \Hat{\Omega}^2 \to \Hat{\Omega}^3$. 
The differential is zero on the odd summand.
We will call this cochain complex $(E_{fivebrane}(\Hat{D}^3), \del)$.

From the description of the fields of the holomorphic twist of the single fivebrane it is easy to see that the Taylor expansion at $0 \in \C^3$ defines a cochain map
\[
(\cE_{fivebrane} (\C^3), Q) \to (E_{fivebrane}(\Hat{D}^3), \del) 
\]
That this induces a quasi-isomorphism $J_0^\infty \cE_{fivebrane} \simeq E (\Hat{D}^3)$ follows from the Dolbeault Poincar\'e lemma.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Enhanced symmetry in a flat background}

\parsec[s:e36]

We recall the definition of the exceptional super Lie algebra $E(3|6)$. 
We follow \cite{Kac_class, KacRudakov}.

The even part of the super Lie algebra $E(3|6)$ is 
\[
\Vect(\Hat{D}^3) \oplus \lie{sl}(2) \otimes \cO(\Hat{D}^3) .
\]
The Lie bracket is determined by the obvious commutators and the action of vector fields on functions. 

The odd part is of the form
\[
\Omega^{-1/2}(\Hat{D}^3) \otimes \C^2 .
\]
where $\Omega^{-1/2}(\Hat{D}^3)$ is the space of formal power series sections of the bundle
\[
\T_{\Hat{D}^3}^{*} \otimes K_{\Hat{D}^3}^{-1/2}
\]
where $K_{\Hat{D}^3}^{-1/2}$ is the negative square-root of the canonical bundle on $\Hat{D}^3$. 
We will write a general element of this module as 
\[
\alpha = \sum_i g^i \d z_i^{-1/2} 
\]
where $g^i \in \cO(\Hat{D}^3)$. 
The action by the even part of the super Lie algebra is by Lie derivative and by the fundamental $\lie{sl}(2)$ action on $\C^2$.
We will write $r \in \C^2$ for a vector in the fundamental representation.
Finally, there is a bracket 
\[
E(3|6)_- \times E(3|6)_- \to E(3|6)_+
\]
defined by
\[
[\alpha_1 \otimes r_1, \alpha_2 \otimes r_2] = - (\alpha_1 \wedge \alpha_2) \otimes (r_1 \wedge r_2) - (\d \alpha_1 \otimes \alpha_2 + \alpha_1 \otimes \d \alpha_2) \otimes (r_1 \odot r_2) .
\]
%The first term in the above equation arises from the composition 
%\[
%(\Hat{\Omega}_3^{-1/2} \otimes \Hat{\Omega}_3^{-1/2}) \otimes (R \otimes R) \xto{\wedge \otimes \wedge} \Hat{\Omega}_3^{-1} \otimes \wedge^2 R \cong \fw_3 .
%\] 
%The second term uses the composition 
%\[
%(\Hat{\Omega}_3^{-1/2} \otimes \Hat{\Omega}_3^{-1/2}) \otimes (R \otimes R) \xto{(\d \otimes \id) \otimes \odot} (\Hat{\Omega}_3^{1/2} \otimes \Hat{\Omega}_3^{-1/2}) \otimes \Sym^2 (R) \cong \lie{sl}(2) \otimes \Hat{\cO}_3 . 
%\] 

\brian{suca enhancement following \cite{SWsuca6d}}

\parsec[s:weight]

In \cite{KacRudakov} an embedding of $E(3|6)$ into $E(5|10)$ is constructed by considering the following auxiliary weight grading on the super Lie algebra $E(5|10)$. 

We first split the coordinates on the formal five-disk as
\[
(z_i ; w_a) \in \Hat{D}^3 \times \Hat{D}^2 .
\]
In the fivebrane picture, the coordinates $z_i$ parameterize the holomorphic directions along the brane and the coordinates $w_a$ are the holomorphic coordinates transverse to the brane.

Assign the following weights to the super Lie algebra $E(5|10)$. 
\begin{itemize} 
\item the coordinate $z_i$ has weight zero, $\wt(z_i) = 0$. 
\item the coordinate $w_a$ has weight $+1$, $\wt(w_a) = +1$. 
\item the parity of an element carries an additional weight of $-1$. 
Thus, for example, the odd element $[w_1 \d z_1] \in \Pi \Omega^1(\Hat{D}^5)/{\rm Im}(\del)$ carries weight $+1 - 1 = 0$. 
\end{itemize} 
The weight grading is concentrated in degrees $\geq -1$. 
In particular, there is a decomposition of super vector spaces
\beqn\label{eqn:decomp1}
E(5|10) = \til V_{-1} \times \prod_{n \geq 0} V_n 
\eeqn
with $\til V_{-1}$ being the weight $-1$ subspace and $V_n$ being the weight $n$ subspace for $n \geq 0$.  
It is straightforward to verify that this weight grading is compatible with the super Lie algebra structure on $E(5|10)$. 
In particular 
\beqn 
\label{eqn:e36iso}
E(3|6) \cong V_0 \subset E(5|10)
\eeqn
is a sub super Lie algebra and each $V_n$ is a module for $E(3|6)$. 

We can extend the weight grading of $E(5|10)$ to a weight grading of the central extension $\Hat{E(5|10)}$ by declaring that the central term have weight $-1$.
In this way, we get a related decomposition of super vector spaces
\beqn\label{eqn:decomp1}
E(5|10) = \prod_{n \geq -1} V_n
\eeqn
Here $V_{-1}$ is a $\C$-extension of the module $\til V_{-1}$ defined in the decomposition above.
Notice that for $n \geq 0$ the $V_n$'s are the same as in the non centrally extended case.
In particular, we have the following. 

\begin{lem} 
The embedding $E(3|6) \hookrightarrow E(5|10)$ lifts to a map of super $L_\infty$ algebras 
\[
E(3|6) \hookrightarrow \Hat{E(5|10)} .
\]
\end{lem}
%\begin{proof}
%It suffices to show that the central extension of $E(5|10)$ splits when restricted to the subalgebra $E(3|6)$. 
%Recall that the even cocycle defining this extension is 
%\[
%(\mu, \mu', \alpha) \mapsto \<\mu \wedge \mu' , \alpha\>|_{z=0} .
%\]
%This is clearly zero since the image 
%\end{proof}

Notice that as a consequence of this decomposition there is a corresponding decomposition of local operators of the eleven-dimensional theory on $\C^5 \times \R$. 
By corollary \ref{cor:sugraops} there is a decomposition of $\Z/2$-graded cochain complexes 
\begin{align*}
\Obs_{sugra} (0) & = \clie^\bu \left( \Hat{V}_{-1} \times \prod_{n \geq 0} V_n \right) \\
& = \Sym(\Pi \Hat{V}^*_{-1}) \otimes \bigotimes_{n \geq 0} \Sym\left(\Pi V^*_n\right) .
\end{align*}
The differential $Q$, which is defined using the Lie bracket on $\Hat{E(5|10)}$ is of the form
$Q = Q_0 + \Hat{Q}$ where $Q_0$ acts on linear generators via
\[
Q_0 \colon V^*_n \to \oplus_{m + \ell = n} V^*_m \otimes V^*_\ell
\]
and $\Hat{Q}$ acts on linear generators via
\[
\Hat{Q} \colon \CC \to \oplus_{m + \ell + n = -1} V^*_m \otimes V^*_\ell \otimes V^*_n .
\]

\parsec[s:locallieE510]

We have recollected how the super Lie algebra $E(5|10)$ (and its central extension) decomposes as a module for the super Lie algebra $E(3|6)$. 
We now wish to lift this to a decomposition of factorization algebras on $\C^3$, or more generally, factorization algebras on any complex three-fold $Z$. 

We outline an approach to constructing the factorization algebras via enveloping factorization algebras of certain (infinite rank) local Lie algebras on the three-fold $X$. 
For another approach \brian{pointer}. 

We have already discussed the local Lie algebra $\cL_{sugra}$ on $X \times S$ where $X$ is a Calabi--Yau five-fold and $S$ is a smooth one-manifold. 
We take $X = Z \times \C^2$ and $S = \R$. 
and view $\Obs_{sugra} = \clie^\bu(\cL_{sugra})$ as a factorization algebra on $Z \times \C^2 \times \R$. 
Then, we can consider the pushforward of $\Obs_{sugra}$ along the map
\[
\pi \colon Z \times \C^2 \times \R \to Z 
\]
which leads to a factorization algebra $\pi_* \Obs_{sugra}$ on the three-fold $Z$. 

Since $\pi$ is not a proper map (the fibers are not compact) we cannot exhibit $\pi_*\Obs_{sugra}$ as the Chevalley--Eilenberg complex of some ordinary local Lie algebra on $Z$. 
Nevertheless we will find a pro local Lie algebra $\cL_{sugra,\pi}$ on $Z$ which is a particularly nice `small model' for this pushforward factorization algebra.

A local Lie algebra enhancement for $E(3|6)$ has been given in \cite{SWsuca6d} \brian{finish}

\begin{prop}
Let $Z$ be a Calabi--Yau three-fold and $\pi \colon Z \times \C^2 \times \R \to Z$ be the projection. 
There is a pro local Lie algebra $\cL_{\pi, sugra}$ on $Z$ such that:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(1)] there is a map of factorization algebras
\[
\clie^\bu(\cL_{\pi,sugra}) \to \pi_* \Obs_{sugra}
\]
which is dense in cohomology. 
\item[(2)] there is a weight grading on $\cL_{\pi,sugra}$ which is concentrated in degrees $\geq -1$ and gives rise to a decomposition of vector bundles
\beqn\label{eqn:decomp3}
\cL_{\pi,sugra} = \prod_{n \geq -1} \cV_{n} 
\eeqn
\item[(3)]
In weight zero, there is an equivalence of local Lie algebras on $Z$ 
\[
\cV_0 \simeq \cE(3|6)|Z .
\]
\end{itemize}
\end{prop}





\section{Example} 

Consider the holomorphic local Lie algebra on $\C^n$
\[
\Omega^{0,\bu}(\C^n) 
\]
and corresponding factorization algebra $\cF = \clie^\bu(\Omega^{0,\bu}(\C^n))$. 
Now, we can restrict this to a factorization algebra on
\[
\C^n - 0 \subset \C^n
\]
that we denote by $\cF|_{\C^n - 0}$. 

Next, consider the radial projection
\[
r \colon \C^n - 0 \to \R .
\]
Notice that $r_* (\cF|_{\C^n - 0})$ will not be the observables of any ordinary local Lie algebra.
Nevertheless we can come up with a nice algebraic model.  

Let $A_n$ be the usual dg model for the formal punctured disk $\Hat{D}^n - 0$ as defined in \cite{FHK,GWkm}.

\begin{lem}
There is an injective map of factorization algebras on $\RR_{>0}$:
\[
\clie^\bu(\Omega^\bu(\RR_{>0}) \otimes A_n) \to r_* (\cF|_{\C^n - 0}) 
\]
which is dense in cohomology.
\end{lem}

This tells us that the correct `fields' of the dimensionally reduced theory on $\RR_{>0}$ is $\Omega^\bu(\R_{>0}) \otimes A_n$.
