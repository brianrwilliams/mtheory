\title{A holomorphic approach to branes in twisted~$M$-theory}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We present a conjectural description of the algebra of operators on a stack of finitely many fivebranes in $M$-theory at the level of the holomorphic twist.
Our approach is through the lens of twisted holography and utilizes a description of the minimal twist of eleven-dimensional supergravity. 
From the conjectural description of local operators we deduce closed formulas for the superconformal index of six-dimensional theories of type $A_{N-1}$.
