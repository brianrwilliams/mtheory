\section{Introduction}

The six-dimensional $\cN=(2,0)$ supersymmetric theory 


In this paper we apply the proposal of \textit{twisted holography} introduced by Costello and Li in \cite{CLsugra} to access the worldvolume theory on a stack of fivebranes in minimally twisted eleven-dimensional supergravity.
Twisted holography shares, in many ways, the spirit of familiar gauge-gravity dualities such as the AdS/CFT correspondence. 
The heart of the program relates the algebra of observables of the bulk gravity theory, which lives on a twisted version of AdS space, to the observables of the worldvolume theory living on a defect, which plays the role of the CFT.
