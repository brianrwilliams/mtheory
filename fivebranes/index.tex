\section{Twisted supergravity states}

\subsection{States in twisted supergravity}

In eleven-dimensional supergravity, the ${\rm AdS}_7 \times S^4$ and ${\rm AdS}_{4}\times S^{7}$ backgrounds are obtained by backreacting a number of fivebranes and membranes respectively in flat space \brian{references}.

In \cite{RSW} we gave descriptions of twisted versions of these backgrounds. We recall this construction, adapted to a slightly more global situation. We will consider the eleven-dimensional theory on 11-manifolds that arise as total spaces of vector bundles. Placing the theory in the backreacted geometry is a 3-step procedure:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Place the eleven dimensional theory on the complement of the zero section. To do so, we will wish to describe the complement of the zero-section in a way that facilitates natural operations on holomorphic-topological local $L_{\infty}$-algebras.

  \item Deform the theory on the complement of the zero section by a certain Maurer--Cartan element.
  The Maurer--Cartan element is thought of as the flux sourced by branes wrapping the zero section.

  \item The complement of the zero section is a manifold with boundary---we impose a natural boundary condition.

\end{itemize}

\parsec[s:brkevin]

As a way to highlight the key aspects of the construction, we consider the simplified model of Costello's twisted $M$ theory on $\R \times \C \times C$, where $C$ is a Riemann surface equipped with a nonvanishing holomorphic one-form $\d z$, with some number of twisted `fivebranes' wrapping
\[
0 \times 0 \times C \subset \R \times \C \times C .
\]
It will be convenient to view $\R \times \C \times C$ as the total space of the real rank two bundle $\R \oplus K_C$ over $C$.
Denote by $(t,w)$ the fiber coordinates.
Removing the zero section and deforming by the backreaction associated to $C$ corresponds to the twisted version of the $S^2 \times AdS_3$ background.
We proceed to describe the twisted version of states at the boundary of this version of $AdS$.
We first proceed before turning on the backreaction.

If we choose a fiberwise partially hermitian metric on the bundle $\R \oplus K_C$ we obtain a projection ${\rm Tot}(\R \oplus K_C) \to \R_+ \times C$ which combines the fiberwise norm with the natural bundle projection.
Denote by $r$ a coordinate for the direction $\R_+$ normal to the brane and let $z \in C$ be a local holomorphic coordinate.
The fibers of this projection away from $r = 0$ are all homeomorphic to the two-sphere.

Compactification along this projection results in a theory with infinitely many Kaluza--Klein modes roughly parametrized by the Cauchy--Riemann cohomology of the two sphere as a hypersurface in $\R \oplus K_C|_z \simeq \R \times \C$.
We will elaborate on the appearance of this sort of cohomology momentarily.
The theory admits a natural `vacuum' boundary condition at $r=0$.
In local coordinates, these are fields $\alpha(t,z,w)$ on the complement to the brane which extend to regular functions along the brane.

The `supergravity states' are, by definition, fields which satisfy the linearized equations of motion and satisfy the vacuum boundary condition except at a single point.
The linearized equations of motion are simply $(\d_{dR} + \dbar) \alpha = 0$.
Thus, up to equivalence, all solutions to the linearized equations of motion are constant in the real variable $t$, and holomorphic in $z,w$.

Modifications of the boundary condition at the point~$z = 0$ on the boundary take the form
\[
\alpha = f(w) \delta^{(r)}_{z=0}
\]
where $f$ is some holomorphic function.
Here $\delta^{(r)}_{z=0}$ denotes the $r$th derivative of the $\delta$-function at $z=0$.
It is convenient to parameterize such boundary modifications algebraically by expressions of the form
\[
\alpha_{k,r} = w^k \delta^{(r)}_{z=0} .
\]
Linear combinations of such states form a dense subspace of all possible modifications at the boundary.

The reason that the boundary modifications take this form can be seen by understanding in more explicit terms the vacuum boundary condition.
The phase space at the boundary $C$ can be identified with the following cohomology
\[
\Omega^{0,\bu}(C) \otimes \cA^{0;\bu}(\R \times \C - 0) [1]
\]
where $\cA^{0;\bu}$ denotes the mixed de Rham--Dolbeault cohomology of $\R \times \C - 0$ as a manifold equipped with a transversely holomorphic foliation.
We refer to the section below for a reminder on this geometric structure.

The phase space is equipped with a natural symplectic form given by
\[
\int_C \d z \oint_{S^2} \d w \, \alpha \wedge \alpha' .
\]
There is a natural Lagrangian inside of the phase space which consists of linear combinations of elements $\alpha(z) \otimes f(t,w)$ where $\alpha(z) \in \Omega^{0,\bu}(C)$ and $f(t,w)$ is a smooth function on $\R \times \C - 0$ which extends to zero.
The linearized equations of motion simply say that $\alpha$ is holomorphic, $f$ is independent of $t$ and depends holomorphically on $w$.

We now consider the situation of backreacting some number of (twisted) fivebranes in our eleven-dimensional model.
Let $Z$ be a three-fold that the fivebranes wrap.
We also fix a rank 2 holomorphic vector bundle $V\to Z$ such that $\wedge^{2} V \cong K_{Z}$, and let $X = \text{Tot}(V)$.
The condition on $V$ ensures that $X$ is a Calabi-Yau five-fold---in the main body of the paper we will choose $V$ to be the bundle $K_{Z}^{1/2}\otimes \C^{2}$.
The eleven-manifold we place our theory on is $\R\times X_V$, which we can view as the total space of the \textit{real} rank five bundle $\R\oplus V$ over $Z$.

We place a stack of $N$ fivebranes wrapping the zero section in $\R\oplus V$.
Denote the complement of the zero section by
\[
M_V = \text{Tot}(\R\oplus V) - 0(Z).
\]
Notice that in \S \ref{s:Lsugra} we have only defined the sheaf of $L_\infty$ algebras $\cL_{sugra}$ on a product of a smooth one-manifold times a Calabi--Yau five-fold.
The eleven-manifold $M_V$ is not of this form, nevertheless there is a generalization of $\cL_{sugra}$ which one can define using the natural geometric structure present in our situation.

A transversely holomorphic foliation (THF) on a smooth manifold $M$ is an integrable subbundle $F \subset \T_M \otimes \C$ such that $F + \Bar{F} = \T_M \otimes \C$.
We will say that $F$ equips $M$ with the a THF structure.
%Suppose $M$ is a manifold equipped with a THF structure and let $\cF$ be the corresponding foliation of even codimension.
The product $M = S \times X$, where $X$ is a complex manifold and $S$ is a smooth manifold has a natural THF structure with $F$ the restriction of the tangent bundle of $N$ along the projection.
Locally, any THF manifold is split of the form $\R^d \times \C^n$, whose coordinates we will denote by $(x_i ;  z_j)$.
The bundle $F$ is locally spanned by the vector fields $\partial / \partial x_i$'s and $\del/\del \zbar_j$'s.
(Notice that when $F \cap \Bar{F} = 0$ we are just describing an ordinary complex structure on $M$.)

Any submanifold of a THF manifold is itself a THF manifold.
We are most interested in the submanifold $M_V \subset {\rm Tot}(\R \oplus V) = \R \times X$ where we equip $\R \times X$ with its standard split THF structure.

We have expressed the fields of the eleven-dimensional theory in terms of a mixed type of de Rham and Dolbeault cohomology.
Let us focus on the fields $\beta,\gamma$ which on $\R \times X$ combine to form the complex
\beqn\label{eqn:drdol}
\Omega^{\bu}(\R) \otimes \Omega^{0,\bu}(X) \xto{1 \otimes \del} \Omega^{\bu}(\R) \otimes \Omega^{1,\bu}(X) .
\eeqn
As usual, we leave the $\d_{dR}$ and $\dbar$ operators implicit.
More generally, there is a natural cohomology associated to a THF structure.
Suppose $(M,F)$ is a THF structure and
denote by $Q$ the (complex) quotient bundle $\T_\C M / F$.
For each $p,q$ denote by $\cA^{p;q}$ smooth sections of the bundle $\wedge^p Q^\vee \otimes \wedge^q F^\vee$.
The derivative along the leaves of the foliation defined by $V$ defines a map
\[
\thfd \colon \cA^{p;q} \to \cA^{p;q+1}  .
\]
By integrability one has $\thfd^2 = \thfd \circ \thfd = 0$ and so $\thfd$ equips $\cA^{p;\bu} = \oplus_q \cA^{p;q}[-q]$ with the structure of a cochain complex for each $p$.
Locally in a split THF structure the operator $D$ is of the form $\d_{dR} + \dbar$ where $\d_{dR}$ is the de Rham differential along $\R^d$ and $\dbar$ is the Dolbeault operator along $\C^n$.
There is also an analog of the holomorphic $\del$ operator which takes the form $\thfdel \colon \cA^{p;q} \to \cA^{p+1;q}$.
The obvious exterior product $\cA^{p;q} \times \cA^{r;s} \to \cA^{p+r;q+s}$ further endows
\[
\left(\cA^{\bu;\bu} (M), \thfd + \thfdel\right) = \left(\oplus_p \cA^{p;\bu}[-p] , \thfd + \thfdel \right)
\]
with the structure of a bigraded commutative dg algebra.
This complex is simply isomorphic to the de Rham complex of $M$, but this presentation lends itself to more interesting quotient complexes.
For example, the forms of type $(p,\bu)$ with $p \geq 2$ form an ideal inside of this dg algebra; hence we get a quotient dg algebra
\beqn\label{thfcoh1}
\left(\cA^{\leq 1;\bu}(M), \thfd + \thfdel\right) = \quad \cA^{0;\bu} \xto{\thfdel} \cA^{1;\bu} .
\eeqn
We leave the $\thfd$ operator implicit in the presentation on the right hand side.
When $M = M_V$, it is this complex that is the THF generalization of the truncated de Rham--Dolbeault complex in \eqref{eqn:drdol}---it is easy to see that it agrees with this complex in the case of a split THF manifold.
There is a similar THF description for the fields $\mu,\nu$ in the eleven-dimensional theory.

%Note that the eleven-manifold $\R \times X$ is equipped with a natural transverseley--holomorphic foliation (THF)---the complexified tangent bundle decomposes as $T_{\R}\oplus T_{Z}\oplus \Bar{T}_{Z}$.
With this THF cohomological description of the eleven-dimensional theory in place we proceed to describe the boundary condition obtained by removing the location of the branes.
We may choose fiber coordinates of the bundle $t, w_{1}, w_{2}$ of $\R \oplus V$ over $Z$ and a fiberwise partially hermitian metric.
Explicitly, the corresponding norm defines a map
\begin{align*}
 h \colon  \R\times X & \to \R_{+} \\
  (t, w_{i}, \bar{w_{i}}, p)& \mapsto t^{2} + |w_{1}|^{2}+|w_{2}|^{2}
\end{align*}
Letting $\pi \colon \R\times X \to Z$ be the natural projection, we obtain the $S^{4}$ bundle
\[
p \define (h,\pi) \colon \R \times X \to \R_{+}\times Z
\]
which restricts to an $S^4$ bundle $p|M \colon M \to \R_{>0} \times Z$.
These embeddings and projections fit inside of the following commutative diagram
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
M \ar[d,"p|M"'] \ar[r,hook] & \R \times X \ar[d,"p"] & \ar[l,hook',"0"'] Z \ar[d,"="] \\
\R_{>0} \times Z \ar[r,hook] & \R_{+} \times Z & \ar[l,hook',"0 \times \id"] Z.
\end{tikzcd}
\]
The inclusions on the left are the natural embeddings.
The top right inclusion is the zero section of ${\rm Tot}(\R \oplus V) = \R \times X$ and the bottom right inclusion is the embedding at radius $r = 0$.

As we just elaborated, the eleven-dimensional theory is defined on the THF manifold $M$---in the BV formalism this is encoded, in part, by the sheaf of $L_\infty$ algebras $\cL_{sugra}$ on $M$.
Compactification of this theory along the $S^4$ link corresponds to pushing forward this sheaf along $p|M$.
The resulting sheaf of $L_\infty$ algebras $(p|M)_*\cL_{sugra}$ describes, in the BV formalism, the compactified theory on the seven-manifold $\R_{>0} \times Z$.

The theory on $M$ extends to a theory on the manifold obtained by filling in the zero section of $\R \times V$; in other words, we know that the theory is defined on the entire space $\R \times X$.
This means that there is a natural way to extend the theory on $\R_{>0} \times Z$ to the seven-manifold with boundary $\R_{+} \times Z$.
The restriction of this theory to the six-dimensional boundary plays the most important role for us.

\brian{trying to incorporate below}
%To do this we will make use of the natural foliated geometric structures which we have around.

Let $V_{M}$ denote the vertical tangent bundle to $(h, \pi)$, which we view as a subbundle of the real tangent bundle $T_{M}$.
The complexification $V_{M}^{\C}$ inherits some natural subbundles coming from the ambient THF structure. Indeed, if $\iota \colon M \to \R\times X$ is inclusion, then we consider the pair
\[
  V_{M}\cap \iota^{*} T_{\R}, \ \ \ \ \ V\cap \iota^{*} T_{Z}.
\]

The fibers of the composition $V_{M}\to M\to \R_{+}\times Z$ are copies of the tangent bundle of $S^{4}$, and the corresponding fibers of $V_{M}$ are subbundles of $TS^{4}$ that equip the fiber 4-spheres with a generalized Cauchy-Riemann structure. \surya{CITE}

 The underlying sheaf of cochain complexes is given by

\[
\Omega^{\bullet}(\R_{+})\otimes \left ( \begin{tikzcd}
\ul{\rm even} & \ul{\rm odd} \\
\PV^{1,\bu}(Z) \ar[r, "\del_{\Omega}"] & \PV^{0,\bu}(Z)\\
\Omega^{0,\bu}(Z) & \Omega^{1,\bu}(Z) \ar[l, "\del"]
\end{tikzcd}
 \right ) \otimes CR (S^{4}).
\]


Here $CR (S^{4})$ denotes the cohomology of the tangential Cauchy-Riemann complex of $S^{4}$ \surya{CITE}, equipped with the above Cauchy-Riemann structure. Its computation is facilitated by the following lemma:

\begin{lem}
  Let $\R^{d}\times \C^{n}$ be an affine THF manifold, and choose a partial hermitian metric. Let $S^{d+2n-1}$ denote the corresponding unit sphere, equipped with its standard generalized Cauchy-Riemann structure. Then there is a quasi-isomorphism

  \[CR (S^{n+2d-1})\cong \cA^{\bu;\bu}\left ( (\R^{d}\times \C^{n})\setminus 0 \right )\]

  where the right-hand-side denotes the Dolbeault-deRham complex.
\end{lem}

The cohomology of the Dolbeault-deRham complex of $\R\times \C^{2}$ is easy to describe.


It was argued in \cite{RSW} that to leading order the coupling of a stack of twisted fivebranes to the eleven-dimensional theory is given by the nonlocal interaction
\beqn\label{eqn:br1}
I_{M5} = N\int_{Z} \div^{-1}\mu \vee \Omega +\cdots
\eeqn
where $\mu \in \Omega^0 (\R) \hotimes \PV^{1,3}(X)$ is a component of a field in the eleven-dimensional theory which satisfies $\div \mu = 0$.

\parsec
Let $C$ be a curve, and let $V\to C$ be a rank 4-holomorphic vector bundle over $C$ such that $\wedge^{4} V = K_{C}$. This condition again ensures that $X = {\rm Tot} V$ is a Calabi-Yau five-fold - in the main body of the paper, we will take $V = K^{1/2}_{C}\otimes \C^{4}$. Abusively letting $V$ also denote its pullback along the canonical projection $\R\times C \to C$, we may view $\R\times X$ as the total space of $V$ on $\R\times C$. As before we will consider wrapping a stack of $N$ membranes along the zero section.

Since $V$ is a complex vector bundle, we may choose a fiberwise hermitian metric, and as before, we may view $\R\times X \setminus \R\times C$ as an $S^{7}$-bundle over $\R_{>0}\times \R\times C$.

%By the usual methods of the BV formalism the action functional $S_{sugra}$ described above endows the parity shift of the fields $\cL_{sugra} = \Pi \cF_{sugra}$ with the structure of a holomorphic-topological local $\Z/2$ graded $L_\infty$ algebra. 
%
%On $\C^5 \times \R$ we can describe this super Lie algebra structure explicitly. 
%First, by the Dolbeault and de Rham Poincar\'e lemmas it is easy that the even part of the super Lie algebra $\cL(\C^5 \times \R)$ is equivalent to a one-dimensional central summand $\C$ plus the Lie algebra of divergence-free vector fields on $\C^5$:
%\[
%\Vect_0 (\C^5) = \{X \in \Vect(\C^5) \; | \; \div X = 0\} .
%\]
%The odd part of the super Lie algebra $\cL(\C^5 \times \R)$ is equivalent to the space of holomorphic one-forms on $\C^5$ modulo exact one-forms
%\[
%\Omega^{1,hol}(\C^5) / {\rm Im}(\del) 
%\]
%which is, of course, equivalent to the space of closed holomorphic two-forms $\Omega^{2,hol}_{cl}(\C^5)$.

%The Taylor expansion map determines a map of $\Z/2$ graded $L_\infty$ algebras

\subsection{Global symmetry for twisted fivebranes}

After complexification, the~six-dimensional superconformal algebra is $\lie{osp}(8|4)$ whose even part is $\lie{so}(8) \times \lie{sp}(4)$. 
This algebra contains the six-dimensional $\cN=(2,0)$ supersymmetry algebra whose odd part is four copies of $S_+$, the positive irreducible complex spin representation of $\lie{so}(6)$.
The holomorphic supercharge is a supertranslation 
\[
Q \in \Pi S_+ \otimes \C^4 \subset \lie{osp}(8|4)
\]
which is characterized (up to equivalence) by the properties that $Q^2 = 0$ and that its image
\[
{\rm Im}\left(Q|_{\Pi S_+ \otimes \C^4} \right) \subset \R^6 \otimes_\R \C \cong \C^6
\]
is three-dimensional (spanned by the anti-holomorphic translations). 
The supercharge $Q$ acts on $\lie{osp}(8|4)$ by commutator and the resulting cohomology will automatically act on the holomorphic twist of any six-dimensional superconformal field theory. 
This cohomology can readily be identified with the subalgebra $\lie{osp}(6|2)$, see \cite{SWe36}. 

In the untwisted situation, the symmetry of solutions to eleven-dimensional supergravity in the presence of fivebranes wrapping a six-dimensional affine subspace is exactly the superconformal algebra $\lie{osp}(8|4)$ (after complexification). 
Geometrically, this background is $AdS_7 \times S^4$. 
In \cite{RSW} we have proposed a twisted analog of the AdS background and have shown that solutions to equations of motion of our eleven-dimensional theory in the presence of twisted fivebranes contains the symmetry algebra $\lie{osp}(6|2)$---which is precisely the twisted superconformal algebra.

In this section we will compute characters of the single-particle gravitational states in our eleven-dimensional model for the geometry resulting from backreacting twisted fivebranes.
Such states have a symmetry by the twisted superconformal algebra $\lie{osp}(6|2)$. 
We will enumerate states via considering a Cartan in the even subalgebra
\beqn\label{eqn:bosonic1}
\lie{sl}(3) \times \lie{sl}(2) \times \lie{gl}(1) \subset \lie{osp}(6|2) .
\eeqn
%We will understand how the twisted superconformal algebra acts on fivebranes via holographic principles.



We recall how the bosonic subalgebra \eqref{eqn:bosonic1} of this twisted superconformal algebra embeds as symmetries of the eleven-dimensional theory in this twisted background. 
This manifests as an embedding of this bosonic subalgebra into the ghosts of the eleven-dimensional theory. 

For convenience we choose coordinates on the eleven manifold as
\[
\R \times \C^5 = \R_t \times \C^2_w \times \C_z^3 
\]
with $z = (z_i), i=1,2,3$ and $w = (w_a), a=1,2$.
The stack of fivebranes wrap $w_1=w_2=t=0$. 
Important for us is to recall that part of the ghost system for our eleven-dimensional theory consists of divergence-free vector fields on $\C^5$ which are locally constant along $\R$. 

\begin{itemize}
\item
The subalgebra $\lie{sl}(3)$ embeds as vector fields
\beqn
\sum_{ij} A_{ij} z_i \frac{\del}{\del z_j} \in \PV^{1,0}(\C^5)\otimes \Omega^0(\R) , \quad (A_{ij}) \in \lie{sl}(3) .
\eeqn
By definition, these vector fields are automatically divergence-free.
\item
The generator of the subalgebra $\lie{gl}(1)$ is mapped to the element
\beqn\label{eqn:Y}
Y = \sum_{i=1}^3 z_i \frac{\del}{\del z_i} - \frac32 \sum_{a=1}^2 w_a \frac{\del}{\del w_a} \in \PV^{1,0}(\C^5) \otimes \Omega^0(\R)  .
\eeqn 
Notice that this vector field are divergence-free and restricts to the ordinary dilation (Euler vector field) along $t=w=0$. 
\item 
The subalgebra $\lie{sl}(2)$ ($R$-symmetry) is mapped to the triple
\beqn
w_1 \frac{\del}{\del w_2}, w_2 \frac{\del}{\del w_1}, \frac12 \left(w_1 \frac{\del}{\del w_1} - w_2 \frac{\del}{\del w_2}\right) \in \PV^{1,0}(\C^5) \otimes \Omega^0(\R) .
\eeqn
\end{itemize}

\begin{rmk}
In the classification of simple super Lie algebras, Kac makes use of a weight grading $\oplus_{j \geq -2} \fg_j$ of $E(3|6)$ for which the finite-dimensional subalgebra above is the weight zero piece
\cite{KacClass}.
\end{rmk}

The dimension of a Cartan subalgebra is four and accordingly, the equivariant character we study has four fugacities.
We choose these explicitly as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $t_{1}, t_{2}$ denote generators for the Cartan of $\lie{sl}(3)$ which is generated by the vector fields
  \beqn
  h_1 = z_1 \del_{z_1} - z_2 \del_{z_2} , \quad h_2 = z_2 \del_{z_2} - z_3 \del_{z_3}.
  \eeqn
   \item $q$ denotes a generator for the Cartan of the~$\lie{gl}(1)$ which is generated by the element~$\eqref{eqn:Y}$. 
  \item $r$ denotes a generator for the Cartan of a $\lie{sl}(2)$ which is generated by the element 
  \beqn
  h = \frac12 \left(w_1 \frac{\del}{\del w_1} - w_2 \frac{\del}{\del w_2}\right) .
  \eeqn
\end{itemize}
The weights are summarized in table \ref{tbl:weights1}.
Recall that the coordinates $(r_1,r_2)$ are used to label the basis of $\C^2$ in the space of fields $\Gamma^{hol}(\Hat{D}^3, K^{1/2}) \otimes \C^2$.

\subsection{Counting supergravity states}

We enumerate single particle supergravity states via computing the super trace of the operator $t_1^{h_1} t_2^{h_2} q^Y r^h$. 
The super trace means that there is an extra factor of $(-1)^F$, where $F$ is parity (fermion number), when computing the ordinary trace.

%The differential is the (algebraic) de Rham differential $\del \colon \Hat{\Omega}^2 \to \Hat{\Omega}^3$. 
%The differential is zero on the odd summand.
%We will call this cochain complex $(E_{fivebrane}(\Hat{D}^3), \del)$.
%
%From the description of the fields of the holomorphic twist of the single fivebrane it is easy to see that the Taylor expansion at $0 \in \C^3$ defines a cochain map

f_{two} (t_1,t_2,q,r) = \frac{q^4(t_1^{-1} + t_1 t_2^{-1}  + t_2) + q^3 (r^2 + r^{-2} + 1) - q^{7/2} (r + r^{-1})(t_1^{-1} + t_1t_2^{-1} + t_2)}{(1-t_1^{-1}q) (1-t_1 t_2^{-1} q) (1-t_2 q)} .

The specialization of this index $t_1=t_2=r=1$ yields the single particle index
\[
\frac{3q^4 + 3 q^3 - 6 q^{7/2}}{(1-q)^3}. 
\]

The specialization of this index $q=r^2, t_2=1$ in \eqref{eqn:special1} yields the plethystic exponential of the following single particle index
\[
f_{two}(t_1, 1, q, q^{1/2}) = \frac{q^2}{1-q} 
\]
which is the same as the single particle index of Virasoro vacuum module on the Riemann surface $\Sigma = \C_{z_1}$. 

\subsection{The large $N$ limit}

We now compute the equivariant character counting local operators of the holomorphic twist of the theory on a large number of fivebranes. 
Unlike the analysis above, we will the twisted holography proposal to compute this character. We consider the equivariant character of local operators of the holomorphic twist of a large number of fivebranes with respect to a finite dimensional subalgebra
\[
\lie{sl}(3)\times \lie{sl}(2)\times \lie {gl}(1)\subset E(5|10)
\]
which embeds in the following way:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Lie algebra $\lie{sl}(3)$ is a subalgebra of $\Vect_0(\Hat{D}^3) \subset \Vect_0 (\Hat{D}^5)$ consisting of linear coefficient vector fields $\sum_{i,j} a_{ij} z_i \frac{\del}{\del z_j}.$
where $(a_{ij}) \in \lie{sl}(3)$. 
\item The Lie algebra $\lie{sl}(2)$ rotates the directions $\C_{w_1} \times \C_{w_2}$ transverse to the brane.
\item The one-dimensional Lie algebra $\lie{gl}(1)$ is spanned by the vector field 
\beqn\label{vf1}
\sum_i z_i \frac{\del}{\del z_i} - \frac23 \sum_{j} w_j \frac{\del}{\del w_j} \in \Vect_0(\Hat{D}^5).
\eeqn
\end{itemize}

Correspondingly, the equivariant character thus has four fugacities, which we label as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $t_{1}, t_{2}$ again denote generators for the Cartan of $\lie{sl}(3)$ acting by vector fields on $\C^{3}_{z}$.
  \item $r$ denotes a generators for the Cartan of a $\lie{sl}(2)$ acting by the fundamental representation on the normal directions $\C_{w_1} \times \C_{w_2}$.
  \item $q$ denotes a generator for the Cartan of additional $\lie{gl}(1)$ generated by the divergence-free vector field \eqref{vf1}. 
\end{itemize}

This choice of weights is summarized in Table \ref{tbl:sugra}.

\begin{prop}
  The character of local operators of the holomorphic twist of the theory on a large number of fivebranes is given by the following plethystic exponential

  \[ \rm PExp [f_{large N}(t_{1}, t_{2}, q, r)] \]

  where the single particle index is \[f_{large N}(t_{1}, t_{2}, q, r) = \frac{q^4(t_1^{-1}+t_1t_2^{-1}+t_2)-q^2(t_1+t_1^{-1}t_2+t_2^{-1})+(q^{3/2}-q^{9/2})(r+r^{-1})}{(1-t_{1}^{-1}q)(1-t_{2}q)(1-t_{1}t_{2}^{-1}q)(1-rq^{3/2})(1-r^{-1}q^{3/2})}.\]
\end{prop}

The specialization $t_1=t_2=r=1$ yields the single particle index
\[
\frac{3 q^4 - 3 q^2 + 2 q^{3/2} - 2 q^{9/2}}{(1-q)^3 (1-q^{3/2})^2} .
\]

\parsec 
The specialization of this index $q=r^2, t_2=1$ in \eqref{eqn:special1} yields the plethystic exponential of the following single particle index
\[
f_{two}(t_1, 1, q, q^{1/2}) = \frac{q}{(1-q)^2}
\]

This plethystic exponential yields the Macmahon function, which is the character of the vacuum module of the $W_{1+\infty}$-algebra.

\parsec The same change of variables in \eqref{eqn:special2} agrees with previously computed indices for single particle states for supergravity on $AdS_{7}\times S^{4}$ \surya{...}
