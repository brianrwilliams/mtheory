relationship to the $S^5$ partition function.

\subsection{Local operators in a holomorphic-topological theory}

\begin{dfn} 
Let $\Obs$ be a factorization algebra on a smooth manifold $M$.
The classical \defterm{point observables} at $p \in M$ is the limit $\Obs(p) = \lim_{U \ni p} \Obs(U)$ where the limit runs over open sets $U \subset M$ containing $p$.
\end{dfn}

\parsec

Without loss of generality we will assume our holomorphic-topological local Lie algebra on $M \times X$ is of the form
\[
\cL = \Omega^\bu (M) \hotimes \Omega^{0,\bu}(X, L) 
\]
where $L$ is a graded holomorphic vector bundle on $X$.

\begin{lem}
\label{lem:localops}
Suppose that $\cL$ is a holomorphic-topological local Lie algebra on $\R^m \times \C^n$ and consider the factorization algebra $\Obs = \clie^\bu (\cL)$. 
Then, the Taylor expansion map
\[
\cL(\C^n \times \R^m) \to L_0[[z_0,\ldots,z_n]]
\]
induces a quasi-isomorphism of commutative dg algebras
\[
\Obs(0) \simeq \clie^\bu \left( L_0[[z_1,\ldots,z_n]] \right) .
\]
\end{lem}

Suppose that $V$ is a translation invariant holomorphic vector bundle on $\C^n$ equipped with a $\Z \times \Z/2$ bigrading. 
Let $\cV$ denote its sheaf of holomorphic sections.
The {\em space of fields} of a holomorphic field theory on $\C^n$ is the $\Z \times \Z/2$ graded complex of vector bundles
\[
\Omega^{0,\bu}(\C^n, V) \cong \Omega^{0,\bu}(\C^n) \otimes V_0 
\]
where $V_0$ is the fiber of $V$ at $0 \in \C^n$.
Our grading conventions are so that $\d \zbar_i$ has bidegree $(1,0)$.

As introduced in \cite{BWhol,LiVertex,CG2}, a {\em holomorphic field theory} is a holomorphic vector bundle $V$ as above equipped additionally with:
\begin{itemize}
\item The structure of a local (super) $L_\infty$ algebra on $V[-1]$ with structure maps given by holomorphic polydifferential operators
\[
[\cdot]_k \colon \cV[-1]^{\times k} \to \cV[1-k] .
\]
\end{itemize}
A {\em free} holomorphic theory has $[\cdot]_k = 0$ for $k > 1$.

\parsec[s:localops]

\begin{eg}
Suppose that $V$ is the trivial bundle on $\C^n$. 
Then, the space of local operators is the symmetric algebra on the topological vector space which is linear dual to 
\[
\cO^{hol}(\Hat{D}^n) = \C[[z_1,\ldots,z_n]] .
\]
Via the $n$-dimensional residue one can identify the algebra of local operators with 
\[
\Sym\left(\frac{\d z_1}{z_1} \cdots \frac{\d z_n}{z_n}  \C[z_1^{-1}, \ldots , z_n^{-1}]\right) .
\]

Consider the standard torus action $\C^\times \times \cdots \C^\times$ on $\C^n$. 
The equivariant character of local operators with respect to this symmetry is given by the plethystic exponential of the following `single particle index'
\[
\frac{1}{(1-q_1)\cdots (1-q_n)} .
\]
\end{eg}

%\parsec[s:sugraops]
%
%By the usual methods of the BV formalism the action functional $S_{sugra}$ described above endows the parity shift of the fields $\cL_{sugra} = \Pi \cF_{sugra}$ with the structure of a holomorphic-topological local $\Z/2$ graded $L_\infty$ algebra. 
%
%On $\C^5 \times \R$ we can describe this super Lie algebra structure explicitly. 
%First, by the Dolbeault and de Rham Poincar\'e lemmas it is easy that the even part of the super Lie algebra $\cL(\C^5 \times \R)$ is equivalent to a one-dimensional central summand $\C$ plus the Lie algebra of divergence-free vector fields on $\C^5$:
%\[
%\Vect_0 (\C^5) = \{X \in \Vect(\C^5) \; | \; \div X = 0\} .
%\]
%The odd part of the super Lie algebra $\cL(\C^5 \times \R)$ is equivalent to the space of holomorphic one-forms on $\C^5$ modulo exact one-forms
%\[
%\Omega^{1,hol}(\C^5) / {\rm Im}(\del) 
%\]
%which is, of course, equivalent to the space of closed holomorphic two-forms $\Omega^{2,hol}_{cl}(\C^5)$. 
%
%\begin{thm}[\cite{RSW}[Theorem 2.1]]
%The Taylor expansion map determines a map of $\Z/2$ graded $L_\infty$ algebras
%\[
%j_\infty \colon \cL_{sugra}(\C^5 \times \R) \to L_{sugra} .
%\]
%Furthermore, $L_{sugra}$ is equivalent as a $\Z/2$ graded $L_\infty$ algebra to $\Hat{E(5|10)}$. 
%\end{thm} 
%
%As an immediate corollary of this result we obtain by Lemma \ref{lem:localops} the following.
%
%\begin{cor}
%\label{cor:sugraops}
%Let $\Obs_{sugra}$ be the factorization algebra on $\C^5 \times \R$ of classical observables of the minimal twist of eleven-dimensional supergravity.
%There is a quasi-isomorphism of commutative dg algebras
%\[
%\Obs_{sugra} (0) \simeq \clie^\bu \left( \Hat{E(5|10)} \right) .
%\]
%\end{cor}

\subsection{Operators on a single fivebrane}

We recalled the description of the holomorphic twist of the theory on a single fivebrane in \ref{s:single}. 
This theory exists on any complex three-fold $X$. 
To describe the algebra of local operators we specialize to $X = \C^3$ and consider the local operators supported at $0 \in \C^3$. 

The theory on a single fivebrane is free and the underlying cochain complex of fields on $\C^3$ is given by 
\beqn
\begin{tikzcd}
\ul{-1} & \ul{0} \\
\Omega^{2,\bu}(\C^3) \ar[r,"\del"] & \Omega^{3,\bu}(\C^3) \\
\Pi \Omega^{0,\bu}(\C^3, K_{\C^3}^{1/2} \otimes \C^2) . 
\end{tikzcd} 
\eeqn
Here we recall the $\Z \times \Z/2$ bigrading where the differential has bidegree $(1,0)$. 


\begin{lem}
\label{lem:single}
The $\Z/2$ algebra of local operators of the holomorphic single fivebrane theory is quasi-isomorphic to the graded symmetric algebra on the linear dual of the topological vector space
\beqn\label{eqn:localfree}
\Pi \Omega^{2,hol}_{cl} (\Hat{D}^3) \oplus \Gamma^{hol}(\Hat{D}^3, K^{1/2}) \otimes \C^2 .
\eeqn
\end{lem}

\parsec

\brian{i think I will recall some of this in the language of `fields' in Section 1, but it'd be good to say a few words about operators.}

In \cite{SW6d} a symmetry by the exceptional super Lie algebra $E(3|6)$ on the holomorphic twist of the free tensor multiplet was constructed.
We recall the action of its even part on local operators of the holomorphic twist of the free tensor multiplet. 
We recount how it acts on the vector space \eqref{eqn:localfree}.
 
Recall that the even part of $E(3|6)$ consists of two summands:
\[
\Vect(\Hat{D}^3) \times \lie{sl}(2) \otimes \cO(\Hat{D}^3) .
\]
Formal vector fields act naturally by Lie derivative on both summands in \eqref{eqn:localfree}. 
An $\lie{sl}(2)$-valued function acts on $\Gamma^{hol}(\Hat{D}^3, K^{1/2}) \otimes \C^2$ where we view $\C^2 = {\rm span}\{r_+,r_-\}$ as the fundamental $\lie{sl}(2)$ representation. 

\parsec

We consider the equivariant character of local operators on the holomorphic twist of a single fivebrane with respect to the following finite dimensional subalgebra of $E(3|6)$ 
\[
\lie{sl}(3) \times \lie{sl}(2) \times \lie{gl}(1) \subset E(3|6) 
\]
which embeds in the following way: 
\begin{itemize}
\item The Lie algebra $\lie{sl}(3)$ is a subalgebra of $\Vect(\Hat{D}^3)$ consisting of linear coefficient vector fields $\sum_{i,j} a_{ij} z_i \frac{\del}{\del z_j}.$
where $(a_{ij}) \in \lie{sl}(3)$. 
\item The Lie algebra $\lie{sl}(2)$ is the subalgebra of $\lie{sl}(2) \otimes \cO(\Hat{D}^3)$ consisting of constant formal series. 
\item The one-dimensional Lie algebra $\lie{gl}(1)$ is spanned by Euler vector field $\sum_i z_i \frac{\del}{\del z_i} \in \Vect(\Hat{D}^3).$
\end{itemize}

\begin{rmk}
In the classification of simple super Lie algebras, Kac makes use of a weight grading $\oplus_{j \geq -2} \fg_j$ of $E(3|6)$ for which the finite-dimensional subalgebra above is the weight zero piece
\cite{KacClass}.
\end{rmk}

The dimension of a Cartan subalgebra is four and accordingly, the equivariant character we study has four fugacities.
We choose these explicitly as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $t_{1}, t_{2}$ denote generators for the Cartan of $\lie{sl}(3)$ which is generated by the vector fields
  \beqn
  z_1 \del_{z_1} - z_2 \del_{z_2} , \quad z_2 \del_{z_2} - z_3 \del_{z_3}
  \eeqn
  on~$\C^{3}_{z}$.
  \item $r$ denotes a generator for the Cartan of a $\lie{sl}(2)$ acting by the fundamental representation on $\C^{2} = {\rm span}\{r_+,r_-\}$. 
  \item $q$ denotes a generator for the Cartan of an additional $\lie{gl}(1)$ which acts by dilations on $\C^3$. 
\end{itemize}
The weights are summarized in table \ref{tbl:weights1}.
Recall that the coordinates $(r_1,r_2)$ are used to label the basis of $\C^2$ in the space of fields $\Gamma^{hol}(\Hat{D}^3, K^{1/2}) \otimes \C^2$. 

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c}
  & $z_{1}$ & $z_{2}$ & $z_{3}$ & $r_{1}$ & $r_{2}$ \\
  \hline
  $t_{1}$ & $1$ & $-1$ & $0$ & $0$ & $0$ \\
  $t_{2}$ & $0$ & $1$ & $-1$ & $0$ & $0$ \\
  $r$ & $0$ & $0$ & $0$ & $1$ & $-1$ \\
  $q$ & $-1$ & $-1$ & $-1$ & $0$ & $0$
\end{tabular}
\caption{Fugacities for a single fivebrane.}
\end{center}
\label{tbl:weights1}
\end{table}

\parsec

We now move on to the computation of the character of local operators on a single fivebrane.
According to the weights listed above and using the description of local operators in Lemma \label{lem:single} we have the following contributions to the character.

\begin{itemize}
\item Single particle operators on the odd copy of holomorphic two-forms $\Pi \Omega^{2,hol}$ contribute
\[
- q^2 \frac{t_1  + t_1^{-1} t_2  + t_2^{-1} }{(1-t_1^{-1}q) (1-t_1 t_2^{-1} q) (1-t_2 q)} 
\]
\item Single particle operators on the even copy of holomorphic three-forms $\Omega^{3,hol}$ contribute
\[
q^3 \frac{1}{(1-t_1^{-1}q) (1-t_1 t_2^{-1} q) (1-t_2 q)} 
\]
\item Single particle operators on $K^{1/2} \otimes \C^2$ contribute
\[
q^{3/2}\frac{(r + r^{-1})}{(1-t_1^{-1}q) (1-t_1 t_2^{-1} q) (1-t_2 q)}
\]
\end{itemize}

Putting this all together we obtain the following.

\begin{prop}
The character of local operators of the holomorphic twist of the theory on a single fivebrane is given by the following plethystic exponential
\[
{\rm PExp} \left[f_{tensor} (t_1,t_2,q,r) \right] .
\]
where the single particle index is
\[
f_{tensor} (t_1,t_2,q,r) = \frac{(r + r^{-1})q^{3/2} - (t_1 + t_1^{-1} t_2 + t_2^{-1} )q^2 + q^3}{(1-t_1^{-1}q) (1-t_1 t_2^{-1} q) (1-t_2 q)} .
\]
\end{prop}

\parsec

A degeneration of this character was computed in \cite{KR1}. 
They compute the absolute (non-super) character of the module $I(0,0;1;-1)$ where they additionally specialize $t_1=t_2=r=1$. 
In a similar method to the one used in \cite{KR1}, one can compute the specialized (super) character of $I(0,0;1;-1)$ to find
\[
\frac{2 q^{3/2} - 3 q^2 + q^3}{(1-q)^3}
\]
which agrees with our direct analysis above.

\parsec

There are various specializations of this character that one can consider. 
One which is motivated from supersymmetry produces...

\begin{itemize}
\item The deformation $\d z_1 \otimes r_+$.
\item The deformation $(z_2 \d z_3 - z_3 \d z_2) \otimes r_-$. 
\end{itemize}

Both deformations break the global Cartan subgroup down to $U(1) \times U(1)$ according to the specializations
\beqn\label{eqn:special1}
q = r^2 , \quad t_2 = 1 .
\eeqn
As one can easily check, this specialization yields the following single particle index
\[
f_{tensor}(t_1, 1, q, q^{1/2}) = \frac{q}{1-q} 
\]
which recovers the single particle index of a single chiral boson on the Riemann surface $\Sigma = \C_{z_1}$. 
Notice that although the Cartan subalgebra generated by the vector field $z_1 \del_{z_1} - z_2 \del_{z_2}$ is unbroken by this deformation, the dependence on its fugacity $t_1$ completely drops out of the expression.

%\parsec[s:singleops]
%
%\begin{prop}
%Let $\Obs_{fivebrane}$ be the observables of the theory on a single fivebrane on $\C^3$ after performing the holomorphic twist.
%There is a quasi-isomorphism of super commutative dg algebras 
%\[
%\Obs_{fivebrane} (0) \simeq \Sym \left( I(0,0;1;-1)^* \right) .
%\]
%\end{prop}
%\begin{proof}
%This follows from Lemma \ref{lem:localops}.
%In \cite{SWsuca6d} a dg lift of Kac's module $I(0,0;1;-1)$ was defined with the following bigraded pieces:
%\beqn
%\text{bidegree} (-1,+)\colon \quad \Hat{\Omega}_3^{2} , \qquad \text{bidegree} (0,+)\colon \quad \Hat{\Omega}^{3}_3
%\eeqn
%and
%\beqn
%\text{bidegree} (-1, -)\colon \quad \Hat{\Omega}^{3/2}_{3} \otimes R .
%\eeqn
%The differential is the (algebraic) de Rham differential $\del \colon \Hat{\Omega}^2 \to \Hat{\Omega}^3$. 
%The differential is zero on the odd summand.
%We will call this cochain complex $(E_{fivebrane}(\Hat{D}^3), \del)$.
%
%From the description of the fields of the holomorphic twist of the single fivebrane it is easy to see that the Taylor expansion at $0 \in \C^3$ defines a cochain map
%\[
%(\cE_{fivebrane} (\C^3), Q) \to (E_{fivebrane}(\Hat{D}^3), \del) 
%\]
%That this induces a quasi-isomorphism $J_0^\infty \cE_{fivebrane} \simeq E (\Hat{D}^3)$ follows from the Dolbeault Poincar\'e lemma.

\subsection{A stack of two fivebranes}

\parsec[]

Recall that the even part of $E(3|6)$ ... 

\begin{itemize}
\item Single particle operators coming from the copy of holomorphic vector fields $\Vect^{hol}(\C^3)$ contribute
\[
q^3 \frac{t_1^{-1} q + t_1 t_2^{-1} q + t_2 q }{(1-t_1^{-1}q) (1-t_1 t_2^{-1} q) (1-t_2 q)} 
\]
\item Single particle operators coming from $\lie{sl}(2)$-valued holomorphic functions $\lie{sl}(2) \otimes \cO^{hol}(\C^3)$ contribute
\[
q^3\frac{r^2 + r^{-2} + 1}{(1-t_1^{-1}q) (1-t_1 t_2^{-1} q) (1-t_2 q)} 
\]
\item Single particle operators coming from the odd piece of $E(3|6)$ which is $\Omega^{1,hol} \otimes K^{-1/2} \otimes \C^2$ contribute
\[
q^{3}\frac{(q^{1/2} r + q^{1/2} r^{-1})(t_1^{-1} + t_1t_2^{-1} + t_2)}{(1-t_1^{-1}q) (1-t_1 t_2^{-1} q) (1-t_2 q)}
\]
\end{itemize}

\begin{conj}
The character of local operators of the holomorphic twist of the theory on a stack of two fivebranes is given by the following plethystic exponential
\[
{\rm PExp} \left[f_{two} (t_1,t_2,q,r) \right] .
\]
where the single particle index is
\[
f_{two} (t_1,t_2,q,r) = \frac{q^4(t_1^{-1} + t_1 t_2^{-1}  + t_2) + q^3 (r^2 + r^{-2} + 1) - q^{7/2} (r + r^{-1})(t_1^{-1} + t_1t_2^{-1} + t_2)}{(1-t_1^{-1}q) (1-t_1 t_2^{-1} q) (1-t_2 q)} .
\]
\end{conj}

\parsec[]

The specialization of this index $t_1=t_2=r=1$ yields the single particle index
\[
\frac{3q^4 + 3 q^3 - 6 q^{7/2}}{(1-q)^3}. 
\]

\parsec[]

The specialization of this index $q=r^2, t_2=1$ in \eqref{eqn:special1} yields the plethystic exponential of the following single particle index
\[
f_{two}(t_1, 1, q, q^{1/2}) = \frac{q^2}{1-q} 
\]
which is the same as the single particle index of Virasoro vacuum module on the Riemann surface $\Sigma = \C_{z_1}$. 

\subsection{The large $N$ limit}

We now compute the equivariant character counting local operators of the holomorphic twist of the theory on a large number of fivebranes. 
Unlike the analysis above, we will the twisted holography proposal to compute this character. 

Let us briefly recall the proposal specialized to our situation \surya{more elaboration elsewhere}. Let $\cL$ denote the local $L_{\infty}$ algebra underlying the minimal twist of 11 dimensional supergravity on $\R_{t}\times \C^{3}_{z_{i}}\times \C^{2}_{w_{a}}$. Consider a stack of $N$ fivebranes supported at the origin in $\R\times \C^{2}_{w_{a}}$ and let $\pi : \R\times \C^{5}\to \C^{3}_{z_{i}}$ denote the canonical projection. The pushforward $\pi_{*} C^{*}(\cL)$ has the structure of a factorization algebra on $\C^{3}$

The twisted holography proposal asserts that the factorization algebra of local observables $\Obs_{M5}$ of the minimally twisted M5 brane theory in the large $N$ limit is a deformation of the Koszul dual $(\pi_{*} C^{\bullet}(\cL))^{!}$.

Since quantities like indices are deformation invariant, we need not consider such deformations for now. In fact in this section we may, and will, replace the local Lie algebra $\cL$ with the abelian local dg Lie algebra which underlies the free limit of the twisted supergravity theory.
Explicitly, $\cL$ is given by the following sheaf of $\Z/2$-graded cochain complexes
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
  &  \ul{\rm even} & \ul{\rm odd} \\
 \mu \in & \Omega^{\bullet}_{\R}\otimes\PV^{1,\bullet}_{\C^{5}} \ar[r, "\del_{\Omega}"] & \Omega^{\bullet}_{\R}\otimes\PV^{0,\bullet}_{\C^{5}}\\
 \gamma \in & \Omega^{\bullet}_{\R}\otimes\Omega^{0,\bullet}_{\C^{5}} \ar[r, "\del"]
& \Omega^{\bullet}_{\R}\otimes\Omega^{1,\bullet}_{\C^{5}}\end{tikzcd}
.\]


\parsec

%Let us describe the restriction $\iota^* \cL$ along the inclusion of the brane.
%The $\mu$-field decomposes into vector field components which point along and transverse to the brane
%\[
%\mu
%\]
%
%is the sheaf of $\Z/2$-graded cochain complexes
%\[
%\begin{tikzcd}
%  &  \ul{\rm even} & \ul{\rm odd} \\
% \mu|_{w=t=0} \in & \PV^{1,\bullet}_{\C^{3}} \ar[r, "\del_{\Omega}"] & \PV^{0,\bullet}_{\C^{3}}\\
% \gamma|_{w=t=0} \in & \Omega^{0,\bullet}_{\C^{3}} \ar[r, "\del"]
%& \Omega^{1,\bullet}_{\C^{3}}\end{tikzcd}
%.\]

We wish to count local operators, which are given by the costalk at $0\in \C^{3}$ of $\Obs_{M5}$. Let us first describe $\Obs_{M5}$ more explicitly. By the Poincare and $\dbar$ Poincare lemmas, we have quasi-isomorphisms for each $U\subset \C^{3}$ open
\[
\Obs_{M5}(U) = \Sym \left( \begin{tikzcd}  \end{tikzcd} \right)
\]

The local observables are given by $\lim _{U\ni 0} \Obs_{M5}(U)$.

We first introduce the following notation for representatives of classes in compactly supported Dolbeault cohomology. We write $\delta^{(a,b,c)}$ to denote the derivative of the delta function $\del_{z_{1}}^{a}\del_{z_{2}}^{b}\del_{z_{3}}^{c}\delta_{t=w_{a}=0}$.

\begin{lem}
  As $\Z/2$-graded vector spaces, we have that \[H^{\bu}\left ( \Obs_{M5}(0)\right )=\Sym (\Pi V_{\gamma}\oplus  V_{\mu})\] where
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $V_{\gamma}$ is spanned by
          \begin{align}
            & \delta^{(0,b,c)}w_{1}^{k}w_{2}^{l}dz_{1} \\
            & \delta^{(a,b,c)}w_{1}^{k}w_{2}^{l}dz_{2}, \ \ \
             \delta^{(a,b,c)}w_{1}^{k}w_{2}^{l}dz_{3} \\
            & \delta^{(a,b,c)}w_{1}^{k}w_{2}^{l}dw_{1}, \ \ \
            \delta^{(a,b,c)}w_{1}^{k}w_{2}^{l}dw_{2}
          \end{align}

          where $a, b, c, k, l \geq 0$.
    \item $V_{\mu}$ is spanned by
          \begin{align}
            & \delta^{(a,b,c)}w_{1}^{k}w_{2}^{l}\del_{w_1}-k\delta^{(a-1,b, c)}w_{1}^{k-1}w_{2}^{l}\del_{z_{1}},\
             \delta^{(a,b,c)}w_{1}^{k}w_{2}^{l}\del_{w_2}-l\delta^{(a-1,b, c)}w_{1}^{k-1}w_{2}^{l-1}\del_{z_{1}}\text{ where }a > 0, b,c,k,l \geq 0 \\
            & \delta^{(0,b,c)}w_{1}^{k}w_{2}^{l}\del_{w_1}-k\delta^{(0,b-1,c)}w_{1}^{k-1}w_{2}^{l}\del_{z_{2}}, \ \delta^{(0,b,c)}w_{1}^{k}w_{2}^{l}\del_{w_2}-l\delta^{(0,b-1,c)}w_{1}^{k}w_{2}^{l-1}\del_{z_{2}}\text{ where }b > 0,c,k,l \geq 0 \\
            & \delta^{(0,0,c)}w_{1}^{k}w_{2}^{l}\del_{w_1}-k\delta^{(0,0,c-1)}w_{1}^{k-1}w_{2}^{l}\del_{z_{3}}, \ \delta^{(0,0,c)}w_{1}^{k}w_{2}^{l}\del_{w_1}-l\delta^{(0,0,c-1)}w_{1}^{k}w_{2}^{l-1}\del_{z_{3}}\text{ where } c > 0,k,l \geq 0 \\
            & \delta^{(0,0,0)}w_{2}^{l}\del_{w_1}, \ \delta^{(0,0,0)}w_{1}^{k}\del_{w_2}\text{ where }k,l \geq 0
          \end{align}
  \end{itemize}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  We compute cohomology using a spectral sequence associated to a two-step filtration by polyvector field and holomorphic form degree. The $E_{1}$ page is the $d+\dbar$ cohomology and is given by the symmetric algebra on

  \[
\begin{tikzcd}
\ul{\rm even} & \ul{\rm odd} \\
H^{\bullet}(\Omega^{0,\bullet}_{c} (\C^{3}, \iota^{*}T_{\C^{5}})) \ar[r, "\del_{\Omega}"] & H^{\bullet}(\Omega^{0,\bullet}_{c} (\C^{3}, \cO) )\\
H^{\bullet}(\Omega^{0,\bullet}_{c} (\C^{3},  \iota^{*}T^{*}_{\C^{5}}))& H^{\bullet}(\Omega^{0,\bullet}_{c} (\C^{3}, \cO)) \ar[l, "\del"]
\end{tikzcd}
.\]

\surya{...}

\end{proof}

\parsec

We consider the equivariant character of local operators of the holomorphic twist of a large number of fivebranes with respect to a finite dimensional subalgebra 
\[
\lie{sl}(3)\times \lie{sl}(2)\times \lie {gl}(1)\subset E(5|10)
\]
which embeds in the following way:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Lie algebra $\lie{sl}(3)$ is a subalgebra of $\Vect_0(\Hat{D}^3) \subset \Vect_0 (\Hat{D}^5)$ consisting of linear coefficient vector fields $\sum_{i,j} a_{ij} z_i \frac{\del}{\del z_j}.$
where $(a_{ij}) \in \lie{sl}(3)$. 
\item The Lie algebra $\lie{sl}(2)$ rotates the directions $\C_{w_1} \times \C_{w_2}$ transverse to the brane.
\item The one-dimensional Lie algebra $\lie{gl}(1)$ is spanned by the vector field 
\beqn\label{vf1}
\sum_i z_i \frac{\del}{\del z_i} - \frac23 \sum_{j} w_j \frac{\del}{\del w_j} \in \Vect_0(\Hat{D}^5).
\eeqn
\end{itemize}

Correspondingly, the equivariant character thus has four fugacities, which we label as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $t_{1}, t_{2}$ again denote generators for the Cartan of $\lie{sl}(3)$ acting by vector fields on $\C^{3}_{z}$.
  \item $r$ denotes a generators for the Cartan of a $\lie{sl}(2)$ acting by the fundamental representation on the normal directions $\C_{w_1} \times \C_{w_2}$.
  \item $q$ denotes a generator for the Cartan of additional $\lie{gl}(1)$ generated by the divergence-free vector field \eqref{vf1}. 
\end{itemize}

This choice of weights is summarized in Table \ref{tbl:sugra}.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c}
  & $z_{1}$ & $z_{2}$ & $z_{3}$ & $w_{1}$ & $w_{2}$ \\

\begin{prop}
  The character of local operators of the holomorphic twist of the theory on a large number of fivebranes is given by the following plethystic exponential

  \[ \rm PExp [f_{large N}(t_{1}, t_{2}, q, r)] \]

  where the single particle index is \[f_{large N}(t_{1}, t_{2}, q, r) = \frac{q^4(t_1^{-1}+t_1t_2^{-1}+t_2)-q^2(t_1+t_1^{-1}t_2+t_2^{-1})+(q^{3/2}-q^{9/2})(r+r^{-1})}{(1-t_{1}^{-1}q)(1-t_{2}q)(1-t_{1}t_{2}^{-1}q)(1-rq^{3/2})(1-r^{-1}q^{3/2})}.\]
\end{prop}

The specialization $t_1=t_2=r=1$ yields the single particle index
\[
\frac{3 q^4 - 3 q^2 + 2 q^{3/2} - 2 q^{9/2}}{(1-q)^3 (1-q^{3/2})^2} .
\]

\parsec 
The specialization of this index $q=r^2, t_2=1$ in \eqref{eqn:special1} yields the plethystic exponential of the following single particle index
\[
f_{two}(t_1, 1, q, q^{1/2}) = \frac{q}{(1-q)^2}
\]

This plethystic exponential yields the Macmahon function, which is the character of the vacuum module of the $W_{1+\infty}$-algebra.

\parsec The same change of variables in \eqref{eqn:special2} agrees with previously computed indices for single particle states for supergravity on $AdS_{7}\times S^{4}$ \surya{...}
