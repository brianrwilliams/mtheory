\subsection{Local operators in a holomorphic theory} 

\parsec[]

Suppose that $V$ is a translation invariant holomorphic vector bundle on $\C^n$ equipped with a $\Z \times \Z/2$ bigrading. 
Let $\cV$ denote its sheaf of holomorphic sections.
The {\em space of fields} of a holomorphic field theory on $\C^n$ is the $\Z \times \Z/2$ graded complex of vector bundles
\[
\Omega^{0,\bu}(\C^n, V) \cong \Omega^{0,\bu}(\C^n) \otimes V_0 
\]
where $V_0$ is the fiber of $V$ at $0 \in \C^n$.
Our grading conventions are so that $\d \zbar_i$ has bidegree $(1,0)$.

As introduced in \cite{BWhol,LiVertex,CG2}, a {\em holomorphic field theory} is a holomorphic vector bundle $V$ as above equipped additionally with:
\begin{itemize}
\item The structure of a local (super) $L_\infty$ algebra on $V[-1]$ with structure maps given by holomorphic polydifferential operators
\[
[\cdot]_k \colon \cV[-1]^{\times k} \to \cV[1-k] .
\]
\end{itemize}
A {\em free} holomorphic theory has $[\cdot]_k = 0$ for $k > 1$.

\begin{eg}
Suppose that $V$ is the trivial bundle on $\C^n$. 
Then, the space of local operators is the symmetric algebra on the topological vector space which is linear dual to 
\[
\cO^{hol}(\Hat{D}^n) = \C[[z_1,\ldots,z_n]] .
\]
Via the $n$-dimensional residue one can identify the algebra of local operators with 
\[
\Sym\left(\frac{\d z_1}{z_1} \cdots \frac{\d z_n}{z_n}  \C[z_1^{-1}, \ldots , z_n^{-1}]\right) .
\]

Consider the standard torus action $\C^\times \times \cdots \C^\times$ on $\C^n$. 
The equivariant character of local operators with respect to this symmetry is given by the plethystic exponential of the following `single particle index'
\[
\frac{1}{(1-q_1)\cdots (1-q_n)} .
\]
\end{eg}

\subsection{Operators on a single fivebrane}

We recalled the description of the holomorphic twist of the theory on a single fivebrane in \ref{s:single}. 
This theory exists on any complex three-fold $X$. 
To describe the algebra of local operators we specialize to $X = \C^3$ and consider the local operators supported at $0 \in \C^3$. 

The theory on a single fivebrane is free and the underlying cochain complex of fields on $\C^3$ is given by 
\beqn
\begin{tikzcd}
\ul{-1} & \ul{0} \\
\Omega^{2,\bu}(\C^3) \ar[r,"\del"] & \Omega^{3,\bu}(\C^3) \\
\Pi \Omega^{0,\bu}(\C^3, K_{\C^3}^{1/2} \otimes \C^2) . 
\end{tikzcd} 
\eeqn
Here we recall the $\Z \times \Z/2$ bigrading where the differential has bidegree $(1,0)$. 


\begin{lem}
\label{lem:single}
The $\Z/2$ algebra of local operators of the holomorphic single fivebrane theory is quasi-isomorphic to the graded symmetric algebra on the linear dual of the topological vector space
\beqn\label{eqn:localfree}
\Pi \Omega^{2,hol}_{cl} (\Hat{D}^3) \oplus \Gamma^{hol}(\Hat{D}^3, K^{1/2}) \otimes \C^2 .
\eeqn
\end{lem}

\parsec

\brian{i think I will recall some of this in the language of `fields' in Section 1, but it'd be good to say a few words about operators.}

In \cite{SW6d} a symmetry by the exceptional super Lie algebra $E(3|6)$ on the holomorphic twist of the free tensor multiplet was constructed.
We recall the action of its even part on local operators of the holomorphic twist of the free tensor multiplet. 
We recount how it acts on the vector space \eqref{eqn:localfree}.
 
Recall that the even part of $E(3|6)$ consists of two summands:
\[
\Vect(\Hat{D}^3) \times \lie{sl}(2) \otimes \cO(\Hat{D}^3) .
\]
Formal vector fields act naturally by Lie derivative on both summands in \eqref{eqn:localfree}. 
An $\lie{sl}(2)$-valued function acts on $\Gamma^{hol}(\Hat{D}^3, K^{1/2}) \otimes \C^2$ where we view $\C^2 = {\rm span}\{r_1,r_2\}$ as the fundamental $\lie{sl}(2)$ representation. 

\parsec

We consider the equivariant character of local operators on the holomorphic twist of a single fivebrane with respect to the following finite dimensional subalgebra of $E(3|6)$ 
\[
\lie{sl}(3) \times \lie{sl}(2) \times \lie{gl}(1) \subset E(3|6) 
\]
which embeds in the following way: 
\begin{itemize}
\item The Lie algebra $\lie{sl}(3)$ is a subalgebra of $\Vect(\Hat{D}^3)$ consisting of linear coefficient vector fields $\sum_{i,j} a_{ij} z_i \frac{\del}{\del z_j}.$
where $(a_{ij}) \in \lie{sl}(3)$. 
\item The Lie algebra $\lie{sl}(2)$ is the subalgebra of $\lie{sl}(2) \otimes \cO(\Hat{D}^3)$ consisting of constant formal series. 
\item The one-dimensional Lie algebra $\lie{gl}(1)$ is spanned by Euler vector field $\sum_i z_i \frac{\del}{\del z_i} \in \Vect(\Hat{D}^3).$
\end{itemize}

Accordingly, the equivariant character we has four fugacities, which we label as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $t_{1}, t_{2}$ denote generators for the Cartan of $\lie{sl}(3)$ which acts by vector fields on $\C^{3}_{z}$.
  \item $r$ denotes a generator for the Cartan of a $\lie{sl}(2)$ acting by the fundamental representation on $\C^{2} = {\rm span}\{r_1,r_2\}$. 
  \item $q$ denotes a generator for the Cartan of an additional $\lie{gl}(1)$ which acts by dilations on $\C^3$. 
\end{itemize}
The weights are summarized in table \ref{tbl:weights1}.
Recall that the coordinates $(r_1,r_2)$ are used to label the basis of $\C^2$ in the space of fields $\Gamma^{hol}(\Hat{D}^3, K^{1/2}) \otimes \C^2$. 

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c}
  & $z_{1}$ & $z_{2}$ & $z_{3}$ & $r_{1}$ & $r_{2}$ \\
  \hline
  $t_{1}$ & $1$ & $-1$ & $0$ & $0$ & $0$ \\
  $t_{2}$ & $0$ & $1$ & $-1$ & $0$ & $0$ \\
  $r$ & $0$ & $0$ & $0$ & $1$ & $-1$ \\
  $q$ & $-1$ & $-1$ & $-1$ & $0$ & $0$
\end{tabular}
\caption{Fugacities for a single fivebrane.}
\end{center}
\label{tbl:weights1}
\end{table}

\parsec

We now move on to the computation of the character of local operators on a single fivebrane.
According to the weights listed above and using the description of local operators in Lemma \label{lem:single} we have the following contributions to the character.

\begin{itemize}
\item Single particle operators on the odd copy of holomorphic two-forms $\Pi \Omega^{2,hol}$ contribute
\[
- q^2 \frac{t_1  + t_1^{-1} t_2  + t_2^{-1} }{(1-t_1^{-1}q) (1-t_1 t_2^{-1} q) (1-t_2 q)} 
\]
\item Single particle operators on the even copy of holomorphic three-forms $\Omega^{3,hol}$ contribute
\[
q^3 \frac{1}{(1-t_1^{-1}q) (1-t_1 t_2^{-1} q) (1-t_2 q)} 
\]
\item Single particle operators on $K^{1/2} \otimes \C^2$ contribute
\[
q^{3/2}\frac{(r + r^{-1})}{(1-t_1^{-1}q) (1-t_1 t_2^{-1} q) (1-t_2 q)}
\]
\end{itemize}

Putting this all together we obtain the following.

\begin{prop}
The character of local operators of the holomorphic twist of the theory on a single fivebrane is given by the following plethystic exponential
\[
{\rm PExp} \left[f_{tensor} (t_1,t_2,q,r) \right] .
\]
where the single particle index is
\[
f_{tensor} (t_1,t_2,q,r) = \frac{(r + r^{-1})q^{3/2} - (t_1 + t_1^{-1} t_2 + t_2^{-1} )q^2 + q^3}{(1-t_1^{-1}q) (1-t_1 t_2^{-1} q) (1-t_2 q)} .
\]
\end{prop}

\parsec

A remark comparing to Kac \cite{KR1}. 

\parsec

There are various specializations of this character that one can consider. 
One which is motivated from supersymmetry produces...

\begin{itemize}
\item The deformation $\d z_1 \otimes r_+$.
\item The deformation $(z_2 \d z_3 - z_3 \d z_2) \otimes r_-$. 
\end{itemize}

Both deformations break the global Cartan subgroup down to $U(1) \times U(1)$ according to the specializations
\beqn\label{eqn:special1}
q = r^2 , \quad t_2 = 1 .
\eeqn
As one can easily check, this specialization yields the following single particle index
\[
f_{tensor}(t_1, 1, q, q^{1/2}) = \frac{q}{1-q} 
\]
which recovers the single particle index of a single chiral boson on the Riemann surface $\Sigma = \C_{z_1}$. 
Notice that although the Cartan subalgebra generated by the vector field $z_1 \del_{z_1} - z_2 \del_{z_2}$ is unbroken by this deformation, the dependence on its fugacity $t_1$ completely drops out of the expression.

\subsection{A stack of two fivebranes}

\parsec[]

Recall that the even part of $E(3|6)$ ... 

\begin{itemize}
\item Single particle operators coming from the copy of holomorphic vector fields $\Vect^{hol}(\C^3)$ contribute
\[
q^3 \frac{t_1^{-1} q + t_1 t_2^{-1} q + t_2 q }{(1-t_1^{-1}q) (1-t_1 t_2^{-1} q) (1-t_2 q)} 
\]
\item Single particle operators coming from $\lie{sl}(2)$-valued holomorphic functions $\lie{sl}(2) \otimes \cO^{hol}(\C^3)$ contribute
\[
q^3\frac{r^2 + r^{-2} + 1}{(1-t_1^{-1}q) (1-t_1 t_2^{-1} q) (1-t_2 q)} 
\]
\item Single particle operators coming from the odd piece of $E(3|6)$ which is $\Omega^{1,hol} \otimes K^{-1/2} \otimes \C^2$ contribute
\[
q^{3}\frac{(q^{1/2} r + q^{1/2} r^{-1})(t_1^{-1} + t_1t_2^{-1} + t_2)}{(1-t_1^{-1}q) (1-t_1 t_2^{-1} q) (1-t_2 q)}
\]
\end{itemize}

\begin{conj}
The character of local operators of the holomorphic twist of the theory on a stack of two fivebranes is given by the following plethystic exponential
\[
{\rm PExp} \left[f_{two} (t_1,t_2,q,r) \right] .
\]
where the single particle index is
\[
f_{two} (t_1,t_2,q,r) = \frac{q^4(t_1^{-1} + t_1 t_2^{-1}  + t_2) + q^3 (r^2 + r^{-2} + 1) - q^{7/2} (r + r^{-1})(t_1^{-1} + t_1t_2^{-1} + t_2)}{(1-t_1^{-1}q) (1-t_1 t_2^{-1} q) (1-t_2 q)} .
\]
\end{conj}

\parsec[]

The specialization of this index in \eqref{eqn:special1} yields the plethystic exponential of the following single particle index
\[
f_{two}(t_1, 1, q, q^{1/2}) = \frac{q^2}{1-q} 
\]
which is the same as the single particle index of Virasoro vacuum module on the Riemann surface $\Sigma = \C_{z_1}$. 

\subsection{The large $N$ limit}

We begin by using the twisted holography proposal to compute an index counting local operators of the holomorphic twist of the theory on a large number of fivebranes. Let us briefly recall the proposal specialized to our situation \surya{more elaboration elsewhere}. Let $\cL$ denote the local $L_{\infty}$ algebra underlying the minimal twist of 11 dimensional supergravity on $\R_{t}\times \C^{3}_{z_{i}}\times \C^{2}_{w_{a}}$. Consider a stack of $N$ fivebranes supported at the origin in $\R\times \C^{2}_{w_{a}}$ and let $\pi : \R\times \C^{5}\to \C^{3}_{z_{i}}$ denote the canonical projection. The pushforward $\pi_{*} C^{*}(\cL)$ has the structure of a factorization algebra on $\C^{3}$

The twisted holography proposal asserts that the factorization algebra of local observables $\Obs_{M5}$ of the minimally twisted M5 brane theory in the large $N$ limit is a deformation of the Koszul dual $(\pi_{*} C^{\bullet}(\cL))^{!}$.

Since quantities like indices are deformation invariant, we need not consider such deformations for now. In fact in this section we may, and will, replace the local Lie algebra $\cL$ with the abelian local dg Lie algebra which underlies the free limit of the twisted supergravity theory.
Explicitly, $\cL$ is given by the following sheaf of $\Z/2$-graded cochain complexes
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
  &  \ul{\rm even} & \ul{\rm odd} \\
 \mu \in & \Omega^{\bullet}_{\R}\otimes\PV^{1,\bullet}_{\C^{5}} \ar[r, "\del_{\Omega}"] & \Omega^{\bullet}_{\R}\otimes\PV^{0,\bullet}_{\C^{5}}\\
 \gamma \in & \Omega^{\bullet}_{\R}\otimes\Omega^{0,\bullet}_{\C^{5}} \ar[r, "\del"]
& \Omega^{\bullet}_{\R}\otimes\Omega^{1,\bullet}_{\C^{5}}\end{tikzcd}
.\]


\parsec

%Let us describe the restriction $\iota^* \cL$ along the inclusion of the brane.
%The $\mu$-field decomposes into vector field components which point along and transverse to the brane
%\[
%\mu
%\]
%
%is the sheaf of $\Z/2$-graded cochain complexes
%\[
%\begin{tikzcd}
%  &  \ul{\rm even} & \ul{\rm odd} \\
% \mu|_{w=t=0} \in & \PV^{1,\bullet}_{\C^{3}} \ar[r, "\del_{\Omega}"] & \PV^{0,\bullet}_{\C^{3}}\\
% \gamma|_{w=t=0} \in & \Omega^{0,\bullet}_{\C^{3}} \ar[r, "\del"]
%& \Omega^{1,\bullet}_{\C^{3}}\end{tikzcd}
%.\]

We wish to count local operators, which are given by the costalk at $0\in \C^{3}$ of $\Obs_{M5}$. Let us first describe $\Obs_{M5}$ more explicitly. By the Poincare and $\dbar$ Poincare lemmas, we have quasi-isomorphisms for each $U\subset \C^{3}$ open
\[
\Obs_{M5}(U) = \Sym \left( \begin{tikzcd}  \end{tikzcd} \right)
\]

The local observables are given by $\lim _{U\ni 0} \Obs_{M5}(U)$.

We first introduce the following notation for representatives of classes in compactly supported Dolbeault cohomology. We write $\delta^{(a,b,c)}$ to denote the derivative of the delta function $\del_{z_{1}}^{a}\del_{z_{2}}^{b}\del_{z_{3}}^{c}\delta_{t=w_{a}=0}$.

\begin{lem}
  As $\Z/2$-graded vector spaces, we have that \[H^{\bu}\left ( \Obs_{M5}(0)\right )=\Sym (\Pi V_{\gamma}\oplus  V_{\mu})\] where
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $V_{\gamma}$ is spanned by
          \begin{align}
            & \delta^{(0,b,c)}w_{1}^{k}w_{2}^{l}dz_{1} \\
            & \delta^{(a,b,c)}w_{1}^{k}w_{2}^{l}dz_{2}, \ \ \
             \delta^{(a,b,c)}w_{1}^{k}w_{2}^{l}dz_{3} \\
            & \delta^{(a,b,c)}w_{1}^{k}w_{2}^{l}dw_{1}, \ \ \
            \delta^{(a,b,c)}w_{1}^{k}w_{2}^{l}dw_{2}
          \end{align}

          where $a, b, c, k, l \geq 0$.
    \item $V_{\mu}$ is spanned by
          \begin{align}
            & \delta^{(a,b,c)}w_{1}^{k}w_{2}^{l}\del_{w_1}-k\delta^{(a-1,b, c)}w_{1}^{k-1}w_{2}^{l}\del_{z_{1}},\
             \delta^{(a,b,c)}w_{1}^{k}w_{2}^{l}\del_{w_2}-l\delta^{(a-1,b, c)}w_{1}^{k-1}w_{2}^{l-1}\del_{z_{1}}\text{ where }a > 0, b,c,k,l \geq 0 \\
            & \delta^{(0,b,c)}w_{1}^{k}w_{2}^{l}\del_{w_1}-k\delta^{(0,b-1,c)}w_{1}^{k-1}w_{2}^{l}\del_{z_{2}}, \ \delta^{(0,b,c)}w_{1}^{k}w_{2}^{l}\del_{w_2}-l\delta^{(0,b-1,c)}w_{1}^{k}w_{2}^{l-1}\del_{z_{2}}\text{ where }b > 0,c,k,l \geq 0 \\
            & \delta^{(0,0,c)}w_{1}^{k}w_{2}^{l}\del_{w_1}-k\delta^{(0,0,c-1)}w_{1}^{k-1}w_{2}^{l}\del_{z_{3}}, \ \delta^{(0,0,c)}w_{1}^{k}w_{2}^{l}\del_{w_1}-l\delta^{(0,0,c-1)}w_{1}^{k}w_{2}^{l-1}\del_{z_{3}}\text{ where } c > 0,k,l \geq 0 \\
            & \delta^{(0,0,0)}w_{2}^{l}\del_{w_1}, \ \delta^{(0,0,0)}w_{1}^{k}\del_{w_2}\text{ where }k,l \geq 0
          \end{align}
  \end{itemize}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  We compute cohomology using a spectral sequence associated to a two-step filtration by polyvector field and holomorphic form degree. The $E_{1}$ page is the $d+\dbar$ cohomology and is given by the symmetric algebra on

  \[
\begin{tikzcd}
\ul{\rm even} & \ul{\rm odd} \\
H^{\bullet}(\Omega^{0,\bullet}_{c} (\C^{3}, \iota^{*}T_{\C^{5}})) \ar[r, "\del_{\Omega}"] & H^{\bullet}(\Omega^{0,\bullet}_{c} (\C^{3}, \cO) )\\
H^{\bullet}(\Omega^{0,\bullet}_{c} (\C^{3},  \iota^{*}T^{*}_{\C^{5}}))& H^{\bullet}(\Omega^{0,\bullet}_{c} (\C^{3}, \cO)) \ar[l, "\del"]
\end{tikzcd}
.\]

\surya{...}

\end{proof}

The index we compute will have four fugacities, which we label as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $t_{1}, t_{2}$ denote generators for the cartan of $SU(3)$ which acts on $\C^{3}_{z}$.
  \item $q$ denotes a generator for the cartan of a $SU(2)$ rotating the normal directions $\C^{2}_{w}$
  \item $r$ denotes a generator for the cartan of an additional $U(1)$ acting on $\C^{5}$ preserving the volume form
\end{itemize}

A convenient choice of choice of weights is as in the following table:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c}
  & $z_{1}$ & $z_{2}$ & $z_{3}$ & $w_{1}$ & $w_{2}$ \\
  \hline
  $t_{1}$ & 1 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
  $t_{2}$ & 0 & 1 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
  $r$ & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 \\
  $q$ & -1 & -1 & -1 & $\frac{3}{2}$ & $\frac{3}{2}$
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{prop}
  The $\SU(3)\times \SU(2)\times U(1)$ character of the large $N$ local operators of the M5 brane theory is given by

  \[ \operatorname{PExp} \left (\frac{q^{3}\left (\begin{aligned} & t_{1}^{-1}q+t_{1}t_{2}^{-1}q+t_{2}q+r^{-1}q^{-3/2}+rq^{-3/2} \\  - & t_{1}q^{-1}-t_{1}^{-1}t_{2}q^{-1}-t_{2}^{-1}q^{-1}-rq^{3/2}-r^{-1}q^{3/2}
          \end{aligned}\right)}{(1-t_{1}^{-1}q)(1-t_{2}q)(1-t_{1}t_{2}^{-1}q)(1-rq^{3/2})(1-r^{-1}q^{3/2})}\right ).\]
  \end{prop}
