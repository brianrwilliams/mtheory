%By the usual methods of the BV formalism the action functional $S_{sugra}$ described above endows the parity shift of the fields $\cL_{sugra} = \Pi \cF_{sugra}$ with the structure of a holomorphic-topological local $\Z/2$ graded $L_\infty$ algebra. 
%
%On $\C^5 \times \R$ we can describe this super Lie algebra structure explicitly. 
%First, by the Dolbeault and de Rham Poincar\'e lemmas it is easy that the even part of the super Lie algebra $\cL(\C^5 \times \R)$ is equivalent to a one-dimensional central summand $\C$ plus the Lie algebra of divergence-free vector fields on $\C^5$:
%\[
%\Vect_0 (\C^5) = \{X \in \Vect(\C^5) \; | \; \div X = 0\} .
%\]
%The odd part of the super Lie algebra $\cL(\C^5 \times \R)$ is equivalent to the space of holomorphic one-forms on $\C^5$ modulo exact one-forms
%\[
%\Omega^{1,hol}(\C^5) / {\rm Im}(\del) 
%\]
%which is, of course, equivalent to the space of closed holomorphic two-forms $\Omega^{2,hol}_{cl}(\C^5)$. 
%
%\begin{thm}[\cite{RSW}[Theorem 2.1]]
%The Taylor expansion map determines a map of $\Z/2$ graded $L_\infty$ algebras
%\[
%j_\infty \colon \cL_{sugra}(\C^5 \times \R) \to L_{sugra} .
%\]
%Furthermore, $L_{sugra}$ is equivalent as a $\Z/2$ graded $L_\infty$ algebra to $\Hat{E(5|10)}$. 
%\end{thm} 
%
%As an immediate corollary of this result we obtain by Lemma \ref{lem:localops} the following.
%
%\begin{cor}
%\label{cor:sugraops}
%Let $\Obs_{sugra}$ be the factorization algebra on $\C^5 \times \R$ of classical observables of the minimal twist of eleven-dimensional supergravity.
%There is a quasi-isomorphism of commutative dg algebras
%\[
%\Obs_{sugra} (0) \simeq \clie^\bu \left( \Hat{E(5|10)} \right) .
%\]
%\end{cor}

\subsection{Global symmetry for twisted fivebranes}

%In \cite{SW6d} a symmetry by the exceptional super Lie algebra $E(3|6)$ on the holomorphic twist of the free tensor multiplet was constructed.
%We recall the action of its even part on local operators of the holomorphic twist of the free tensor multiplet. 
%We recount how it acts on the vector space \eqref{eqn:localfree}.
% 
%Recall that the even part of $E(3|6)$ consists of two summands:
%\[
%\Vect(\Hat{D}^3) \times \lie{sl}(2) \otimes \cO(\Hat{D}^3) .
%\]
%Formal vector fields act naturally by Lie derivative on both summands in \eqref{eqn:localfree}. 
%An $\lie{sl}(2)$-valued function acts on $\Gamma^{hol}(\Hat{D}^3, K^{1/2}) \otimes \C^2$ where we view $\C^2 = {\rm span}\{r_+,r_-\}$ as the fundamental $\lie{sl}(2)$ representation. 

After complexification, the~six-dimensional superconformal algebra is $\lie{osp}(8|4)$ whose even part is $\lie{so}(8) \times \lie{sp}(4)$. 
This algebra contains the $\cN=(2,0)$ supersymmetry algebra whose odd part is four copies of $S_+$, the positive irreducible complex spin representation of $\lie{so}(6)$.
The holomorphic supercharge is a supertranslation 
\[
Q \in \Pi S_+ \otimes \C^4 \subset \lie{osp}(8|4)
\]
which is characterized (up to equivalence) by the properties that $Q^2 = 0$ and that its image
\[
{\rm Im}\left(Q|_{\Pi S_+ \otimes \C^4} \right) \subset \R^6 \otimes_\R \C \cong \C^6
\]
is three-dimensional (spanned by the anti-holomorphic translations). 
The supercharge $Q$ acts on $\lie{osp}(8|4)$ by commutator and the resulting cohomology will automatically act on the holomorphic twist of any six-dimensional superconformal field theory. 
This cohomology can readily be identified with the subalgebra $\lie{osp}(6|2)$, see \cite{SWe36}. 

To compute characters of local operators the fivebrane worldvolume theory we will consider the symmetry of the holomorphic twist of a six-dimensional superconormal theory with respect to the even subalgebra 
\beqn\label{eqn:bosonic1}
\lie{sl}(3) \times \lie{sl}(2) \times \lie{gl}(1) \subset \lie{osp}(6|2) .
\eeqn
We will understand how the twisted superconformal algebra acts on fivebranes via holographic principles.

In the untwisted situation, the symmetry of solutions to eleven-dimensional supergravity in the presence of fivebranes wrapping a six-dimensional affine subspace is exactly the superconformal algebra $\lie{osp}(8|4)$ (after complexification). 
Geometrically, this background is $AdS_7 \times S^4$. 
In \cite{RSW} we have proposed a twisted analog of the AdS background and have shown that solutions to equations of motion of our eleven-dimensional theory in the presence of twisted fivebranes contains the symmetry algebra $\lie{osp}(6|2)$---which is precisely the twisted superconformal algebra.

We recall how the bosonic subalgebra \eqref{eqn:bosonic1} of this twisted superconformal algebra embeds as symmetries of the eleven-dimensional theory in this twisted background. 
This manifests as an embedding of this bosonic subalgebra into the ghosts of the eleven-dimensional theory. 

For convenience we choose coordinates on the eleven manifold as
\[
\C^5 \times \R = \C_z^3 \times \C_w^2 \times \R_t
\]
with $z_i, i=1,2,3$ and $w_a, a=1,2$.
The stack of fivebranes wrap $w_1=w_2=t=0$. 
Important for us is to recall that part of the ghost system for our eleven-dimensional theory consists of divergence-free vector fields on $\C^5$ which are locally constant along $\R$. 

\begin{itemize}
\item
The subalgebra $\lie{sl}(3)$ embeds as vector fields
\[
\sum_{ij} A_{ij} z_i \frac{\del}{\del z_j} \in \PV^{1,0}(\C^5)\otimes \Omega^0(\R) , \quad (A_{ij}) \in \lie{sl}(3) .
\]
\item
The subalgebra $\lie{gl}(1)$ is mapped to the element
\[
\sum_{i=1}^3 z_i \frac{\del}{\del z_i} - \frac32 \sum_{a=1}^2 w_a \frac{\del}{\del w_a} \in \PV^{1,0}(\C^5) \otimes \Omega^0(\R)  .
\] 
Notice that this vector field are divergence-free and restricts to the ordinary dilation (Euler vector field) along $w=0$. 
\item 
The subalgebra $\lie{sl}(2)$ ($R$-symmetry) is mapped to the triple
\[
w_1 \frac{\del}{\del w_2}, w_2 \frac{\del}{\del w_1}, \frac12 \left(w_1 \frac{\del}{\del w_1} - w_2 \frac{\del}{\del w_2}\right) \in \PV^{1,0}(\C^5) \otimes \Omega^0(\R) .
\]
\end{itemize}

\begin{rmk}
In the classification of simple super Lie algebras, Kac makes use of a weight grading $\oplus_{j \geq -2} \fg_j$ of $E(3|6)$ for which the finite-dimensional subalgebra above is the weight zero piece
\cite{KacClass}.
\end{rmk}

The dimension of a Cartan subalgebra is four and accordingly, the equivariant character we study has four fugacities.
We choose these explicitly as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $t_{1}, t_{2}$ denote generators for the Cartan of $\lie{sl}(3)$ which is generated by the vector fields
  \beqn
  z_1 \del_{z_1} - z_2 \del_{z_2} , \quad z_2 \del_{z_2} - z_3 \del_{z_3}
  \eeqn
  on~$\C^{3}_{z}$.
  \item $r$ denotes a generator for the Cartan of a $\lie{sl}(2)$ acting by the fundamental representation on $\C^{2} = {\rm span}\{r_+,r_-\}$. 
  \item $q$ denotes a generator for the Cartan of an additional $\lie{gl}(1)$ which acts by dilations on $\C^3$. 
\end{itemize}
The weights are summarized in table \ref{tbl:weights1}.
Recall that the coordinates $(r_1,r_2)$ are used to label the basis of $\C^2$ in the space of fields $\Gamma^{hol}(\Hat{D}^3, K^{1/2}) \otimes \C^2$. 

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c}
  & $z_{1}$ & $z_{2}$ & $z_{3}$ & $r_{1}$ & $r_{2}$ \\
  \hline
  $t_{1}$ & $1$ & $-1$ & $0$ & $0$ & $0$ \\
  $t_{2}$ & $0$ & $1$ & $-1$ & $0$ & $0$ \\
  $r$ & $0$ & $0$ & $0$ & $1$ & $-1$ \\
  $q$ & $-1$ & $-1$ & $-1$ & $0$ & $0$

\subsection{Operators on a single fivebrane}

We recalled the description of the holomorphic twist of the theory on a single fivebrane in \ref{s:single}. 
This theory exists on any complex three-fold $X$. 
To describe the algebra of local operators we specialize to $X = \C^3$ and consider the local operators supported at $0 \in \C^3$. 

The theory on a single fivebrane is free and the underlying cochain complex of the abelian holomorphic local Lie algebra on $\C^3$ is given by 
\beqn
\begin{tikzcd}
\ul{-1} & \ul{0} \\
\Omega^{2,\bu}(\C^3) \ar[r,"\del"] & \Omega^{3,\bu}(\C^3) \\
\Pi \Omega^{0,\bu}(\C^3, K_{\C^3}^{1/2} \otimes \C^2) . 
\end{tikzcd} 
\eeqn
Here we recall the $\Z \times \Z/2$ bigrading where the differential has bidegree $(1,0)$. 


\begin{lem}
\label{lem:single}
The $\Z \times \Z/2$ algebra of local operators of the holomorphic single fivebrane theory is quasi-isomorphic to the graded symmetric algebra on the linear dual of the topological vector space
\beqn\label{eqn:localfree}
\Omega^{2}_{cl} (\Hat{D}^3)[1] \oplus \Pi \Omega^0(\Hat{D}^3, K^{1/2}) \otimes \C^2 [1].
\eeqn
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
The jet expansion at $0 \in \C^3$ determines a map from the section of the abelian holomorphic-topological local Lie algebra on $\C^3$ to the cochain complex
\beqn
\begin{tikzcd}
\ul{-1} & \ul{0} \\
\Omega^{2}(\Hat{D}^3) \ar[r,"\del"] & \Omega^{3}(\Hat{D}^3) \\
\Pi \Omega^0(\Hat{D}^3, K^{1/2} \otimes \C^2) . 
\end{tikzcd} 
\eeqn
On the formal disk all closed two-forms are automatically exact, which implies the lemma.
\end{proof}

\parsec

We now move on to the computation of the character of local operators on a single fivebrane.
According to the weights listed above and using the description of local operators in Lemma \label{lem:single} we have the following contributions to the character.

\begin{itemize}
\item Single particle operators on the odd copy of holomorphic two-forms $\Pi \Omega^{2,hol}$ contribute
\[
- q^2 \frac{t_1  + t_1^{-1} t_2  + t_2^{-1} }{(1-t_1^{-1}q) (1-t_1 t_2^{-1} q) (1-t_2 q)} 
\]
\item Single particle operators on the even copy of holomorphic three-forms $\Omega^{3,hol}$ contribute
\[
q^3 \frac{1}{(1-t_1^{-1}q) (1-t_1 t_2^{-1} q) (1-t_2 q)} 
\]
\item Single particle operators on $K^{1/2} \otimes \C^2$ contribute
\[
q^{3/2}\frac{(r + r^{-1})}{(1-t_1^{-1}q) (1-t_1 t_2^{-1} q) (1-t_2 q)}
\]
\end{itemize}

Putting this all together we obtain the following.

\begin{prop}
The character of local operators of the holomorphic twist of the theory on a single fivebrane is given by the following plethystic exponential
\[
{\rm PExp} \left[f_{tensor} (t_1,t_2,q,r) \right] .
\]
where the single particle index is
\[
f_{tensor} (t_1,t_2,q,r) = \frac{(r + r^{-1})q^{3/2} - (t_1 + t_1^{-1} t_2 + t_2^{-1} )q^2 + q^3}{(1-t_1^{-1}q) (1-t_1 t_2^{-1} q) (1-t_2 q)} .
\]
\end{prop}

\parsec

A degeneration of this character was computed in \cite{KR1}. 
They compute the absolute (non-super) character of the module $I(0,0;1;-1)$ where they additionally specialize $t_1=t_2=r=1$. 
In a similar method to the one used in \cite{KR1}, one can compute the specialized (super) character of $I(0,0;1;-1)$ to find
\[
\frac{2 q^{3/2} - 3 q^2 + q^3}{(1-q)^3}
\]
which agrees with our direct analysis above.

\parsec

There are various specializations of this character that one can consider. 
One which is motivated from supersymmetry produces...

\begin{itemize}
\item The deformation $\d z_1 \otimes r_+$.
\item The deformation $(z_2 \d z_3 - z_3 \d z_2) \otimes r_-$. 
\end{itemize}

Both deformations break the global Cartan subgroup down to $U(1) \times U(1)$ according to the specializations
\beqn\label{eqn:special1}
q = r^2 , \quad t_2 = 1 .
\eeqn
As one can easily check, this specialization yields the following single particle index
\[
f_{tensor}(t_1, 1, q, q^{1/2}) = \frac{q}{1-q} 
\]
which recovers the single particle index of a single chiral boson on the Riemann surface $\Sigma = \C_{z_1}$. 
Notice that although the Cartan subalgebra generated by the vector field $z_1 \del_{z_1} - z_2 \del_{z_2}$ is unbroken by this deformation, the dependence on its fugacity $t_1$ completely drops out of the expression.

%\parsec[s:singleops]
%
%\begin{prop}
%Let $\Obs_{fivebrane}$ be the observables of the theory on a single fivebrane on $\C^3$ after performing the holomorphic twist.
%There is a quasi-isomorphism of super commutative dg algebras 
%\[
%\Obs_{fivebrane} (0) \simeq \Sym \left( I(0,0;1;-1)^* \right) .
%\]
%\end{prop}
%\begin{proof}
%This follows from Lemma \ref{lem:localops}.
%In \cite{SWsuca6d} a dg lift of Kac's module $I(0,0;1;-1)$ was defined with the following bigraded pieces:
%\beqn
%\text{bidegree} (-1,+)\colon \quad \Hat{\Omega}_3^{2} , \qquad \text{bidegree} (0,+)\colon \quad \Hat{\Omega}^{3}_3
%\eeqn
%and
%\beqn
%\text{bidegree} (-1, -)\colon \quad \Hat{\Omega}^{3/2}_{3} \otimes R .
%\eeqn
%The differential is the (algebraic) de Rham differential $\del \colon \Hat{\Omega}^2 \to \Hat{\Omega}^3$. 
%The differential is zero on the odd summand.
%We will call this cochain complex $(E_{fivebrane}(\Hat{D}^3), \del)$.
%
%From the description of the fields of the holomorphic twist of the single fivebrane it is easy to see that the Taylor expansion at $0 \in \C^3$ defines a cochain map
%\[
%(\cE_{fivebrane} (\C^3), Q) \to (E_{fivebrane}(\Hat{D}^3), \del) 
%\]
%That this induces a quasi-isomorphism $J_0^\infty \cE_{fivebrane} \simeq E (\Hat{D}^3)$ follows from the Dolbeault Poincar\'e lemma.
%\end{proof}

\subsection{A stack of two fivebranes}

\parsec[]

Recall that the even part of $E(3|6)$ ... 

\begin{itemize}
\item Single particle operators coming from the copy of holomorphic vector fields $\Vect^{hol}(\C^3)$ contribute
\[
q^3 \frac{t_1^{-1} q + t_1 t_2^{-1} q + t_2 q }{(1-t_1^{-1}q) (1-t_1 t_2^{-1} q) (1-t_2 q)} 
\]
\item Single particle operators coming from $\lie{sl}(2)$-valued holomorphic functions $\lie{sl}(2) \otimes \cO^{hol}(\C^3)$ contribute
\[
q^3\frac{r^2 + r^{-2} + 1}{(1-t_1^{-1}q) (1-t_1 t_2^{-1} q) (1-t_2 q)} 
\]
\item Single particle operators coming from the odd piece of $E(3|6)$ which is $\Omega^{1,hol} \otimes K^{-1/2} \otimes \C^2$ contribute
\[
q^{3}\frac{(q^{1/2} r + q^{1/2} r^{-1})(t_1^{-1} + t_1t_2^{-1} + t_2)}{(1-t_1^{-1}q) (1-t_1 t_2^{-1} q) (1-t_2 q)}
\]
\end{itemize}

\begin{conj}
The character of local operators of the holomorphic twist of the theory on a stack of two fivebranes is given by the following plethystic exponential
\[
{\rm PExp} \left[f_{two} (t_1,t_2,q,r) \right] .
\]
where the single particle index is
\[
f_{two} (t_1,t_2,q,r) = \frac{q^4(t_1^{-1} + t_1 t_2^{-1}  + t_2) + q^3 (r^2 + r^{-2} + 1) - q^{7/2} (r + r^{-1})(t_1^{-1} + t_1t_2^{-1} + t_2)}{(1-t_1^{-1}q) (1-t_1 t_2^{-1} q) (1-t_2 q)} .
\]
\end{conj}

\parsec[]

The specialization of this index $t_1=t_2=r=1$ yields the single particle index
\[
\frac{3q^4 + 3 q^3 - 6 q^{7/2}}{(1-q)^3}. 
\]

\parsec[]

The specialization of this index $q=r^2, t_2=1$ in \eqref{eqn:special1} yields the plethystic exponential of the following single particle index
\[
f_{two}(t_1, 1, q, q^{1/2}) = \frac{q^2}{1-q} 
\]
which is the same as the single particle index of Virasoro vacuum module on the Riemann surface $\Sigma = \C_{z_1}$. 

\subsection{The large $N$ limit}

We now compute the equivariant character counting local operators of the holomorphic twist of the theory on a large number of fivebranes. 
Unlike the analysis above, we will the twisted holography proposal to compute this character. 

Let us briefly recall the proposal specialized to our situation \surya{more elaboration elsewhere}. Let $\cL$ denote the local $L_{\infty}$ algebra underlying the minimal twist of 11 dimensional supergravity on $\R_{t}\times \C^{3}_{z_{i}}\times \C^{2}_{w_{a}}$. Consider a stack of $N$ fivebranes supported at the origin in $\R\times \C^{2}_{w_{a}}$ and let $\pi : \R\times \C^{5}\to \C^{3}_{z_{i}}$ denote the canonical projection. The pushforward $\pi_{*} C^{*}(\cL)$ has the structure of a factorization algebra on $\C^{3}$

The twisted holography proposal asserts that the factorization algebra of local observables $\Obs_{M5}$ of the minimally twisted M5 brane theory in the large $N$ limit is a deformation of the Koszul dual $(\pi_{*} C^{\bullet}(\cL))^{!}$.

Since quantities like indices are deformation invariant, we need not consider such deformations for now. In fact in this section we may, and will, replace the local Lie algebra $\cL$ with the abelian local dg Lie algebra which underlies the free limit of the twisted supergravity theory.
Explicitly, $\cL$ is given by the following sheaf of $\Z/2$-graded cochain complexes
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
  &  \ul{\rm even} & \ul{\rm odd} \\
 \mu \in & \Omega^{\bullet}_{\R}\otimes\PV^{1,\bullet}_{\C^{5}} \ar[r, "\del_{\Omega}"] & \Omega^{\bullet}_{\R}\otimes\PV^{0,\bullet}_{\C^{5}}\\
 \gamma \in & \Omega^{\bullet}_{\R}\otimes\Omega^{0,\bullet}_{\C^{5}} \ar[r, "\del"]
& \Omega^{\bullet}_{\R}\otimes\Omega^{1,\bullet}_{\C^{5}}\end{tikzcd}
.\]


\parsec

%Let us describe the restriction $\iota^* \cL$ along the inclusion of the brane.
%The $\mu$-field decomposes into vector field components which point along and transverse to the brane
%\[
%\mu
%\]
%
%is the sheaf of $\Z/2$-graded cochain complexes
%\[
%\begin{tikzcd}
%  &  \ul{\rm even} & \ul{\rm odd} \\
% \mu|_{w=t=0} \in & \PV^{1,\bullet}_{\C^{3}} \ar[r, "\del_{\Omega}"] & \PV^{0,\bullet}_{\C^{3}}\\
% \gamma|_{w=t=0} \in & \Omega^{0,\bullet}_{\C^{3}} \ar[r, "\del"]
%& \Omega^{1,\bullet}_{\C^{3}}\end{tikzcd}
%.\]

We wish to count local operators, which are given by the costalk at $0\in \C^{3}$ of $\Obs_{M5}$. Let us first describe $\Obs_{M5}$ more explicitly. By the Poincare and $\dbar$ Poincare lemmas, we have quasi-isomorphisms for each $U\subset \C^{3}$ open
\[
\Obs_{M5}(U) = \Sym \left( \begin{tikzcd}  \end{tikzcd} \right)
\]

The local observables are given by $\lim _{U\ni 0} \Obs_{M5}(U)$.

We first introduce the following notation for representatives of classes in compactly supported Dolbeault cohomology. We write $\delta^{(a,b,c)}$ to denote the derivative of the delta function $\del_{z_{1}}^{a}\del_{z_{2}}^{b}\del_{z_{3}}^{c}\delta_{t=w_{a}=0}$.

\begin{lem}
  As $\Z/2$-graded vector spaces, we have that \[H^{\bu}\left ( \Obs_{M5}(0)\right )=\Sym (\Pi V_{\gamma}\oplus  V_{\mu})\] where
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $V_{\gamma}$ is spanned by
          \begin{align}
            & \delta^{(0,b,c)}w_{1}^{k}w_{2}^{l}dz_{1} \\
            & \delta^{(a,b,c)}w_{1}^{k}w_{2}^{l}dz_{2}, \ \ \
             \delta^{(a,b,c)}w_{1}^{k}w_{2}^{l}dz_{3} \\
            & \delta^{(a,b,c)}w_{1}^{k}w_{2}^{l}dw_{1}, \ \ \
            \delta^{(a,b,c)}w_{1}^{k}w_{2}^{l}dw_{2}
          \end{align}

          where $a, b, c, k, l \geq 0$.
    \item $V_{\mu}$ is spanned by
          \begin{align}
            & \delta^{(a,b,c)}w_{1}^{k}w_{2}^{l}\del_{w_1}-k\delta^{(a-1,b, c)}w_{1}^{k-1}w_{2}^{l}\del_{z_{1}},\
             \delta^{(a,b,c)}w_{1}^{k}w_{2}^{l}\del_{w_2}-l\delta^{(a-1,b, c)}w_{1}^{k-1}w_{2}^{l-1}\del_{z_{1}}\text{ where }a > 0, b,c,k,l \geq 0 \\
            & \delta^{(0,b,c)}w_{1}^{k}w_{2}^{l}\del_{w_1}-k\delta^{(0,b-1,c)}w_{1}^{k-1}w_{2}^{l}\del_{z_{2}}, \ \delta^{(0,b,c)}w_{1}^{k}w_{2}^{l}\del_{w_2}-l\delta^{(0,b-1,c)}w_{1}^{k}w_{2}^{l-1}\del_{z_{2}}\text{ where }b > 0,c,k,l \geq 0 \\

            & \delta^{(0,0,0)}w_{2}^{l}\del_{w_1}, \ \delta^{(0,0,0)}w_{1}^{k}\del_{w_2}\text{ where }k,l \geq 0
          \end{align}
  \end{itemize}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  We compute cohomology using a spectral sequence associated to a two-step filtration by polyvector field and holomorphic form degree. The $E_{1}$ page is the $d+\dbar$ cohomology and is given by the symmetric algebra on

We consider the equivariant character of local operators of the holomorphic twist of a large number of fivebranes with respect to a finite dimensional subalgebra 
\[
\lie{sl}(3)\times \lie{sl}(2)\times \lie {gl}(1)\subset E(5|10)
\]
which embeds in the following way:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Lie algebra $\lie{sl}(3)$ is a subalgebra of $\Vect_0(\Hat{D}^3) \subset \Vect_0 (\Hat{D}^5)$ consisting of linear coefficient vector fields $\sum_{i,j} a_{ij} z_i \frac{\del}{\del z_j}.$
where $(a_{ij}) \in \lie{sl}(3)$. 
\item The Lie algebra $\lie{sl}(2)$ rotates the directions $\C_{w_1} \times \C_{w_2}$ transverse to the brane.
\item The one-dimensional Lie algebra $\lie{gl}(1)$ is spanned by the vector field 
\beqn\label{vf1}
\sum_i z_i \frac{\del}{\del z_i} - \frac23 \sum_{j} w_j \frac{\del}{\del w_j} \in \Vect_0(\Hat{D}^5).
\eeqn
\end{itemize}

Correspondingly, the equivariant character thus has four fugacities, which we label as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $t_{1}, t_{2}$ again denote generators for the Cartan of $\lie{sl}(3)$ acting by vector fields on $\C^{3}_{z}$.
  \item $r$ denotes a generators for the Cartan of a $\lie{sl}(2)$ acting by the fundamental representation on the normal directions $\C_{w_1} \times \C_{w_2}$.

\begin{prop}
  The character of local operators of the holomorphic twist of the theory on a large number of fivebranes is given by the following plethystic exponential

  \[ \rm PExp [f_{large N}(t_{1}, t_{2}, q, r)] \]

  where the single particle index is \[f_{large N}(t_{1}, t_{2}, q, r) = \frac{q^4(t_1^{-1}+t_1t_2^{-1}+t_2)-q^2(t_1+t_1^{-1}t_2+t_2^{-1})+(q^{3/2}-q^{9/2})(r+r^{-1})}{(1-t_{1}^{-1}q)(1-t_{2}q)(1-t_{1}t_{2}^{-1}q)(1-rq^{3/2})(1-r^{-1}q^{3/2})}.\]
\end{prop}

The specialization $t_1=t_2=r=1$ yields the single particle index
\[
\frac{3 q^4 - 3 q^2 + 2 q^{3/2} - 2 q^{9/2}}{(1-q)^3 (1-q^{3/2})^2} .
\]

\parsec 
The specialization of this index $q=r^2, t_2=1$ in \eqref{eqn:special1} yields the plethystic exponential of the following single particle index
\[
f_{two}(t_1, 1, q, q^{1/2}) = \frac{q}{(1-q)^2}
\]

This plethystic exponential yields the Macmahon function, which is the character of the vacuum module of the $W_{1+\infty}$-algebra.

\parsec The same change of variables in \eqref{eqn:special2} agrees with previously computed indices for single particle states for supergravity on $AdS_{7}\times S^{4}$ \surya{...}
