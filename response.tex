\title{Response to referee report \\ ``title''}

\maketitle

We want to express our deep gratitude to the referee for the extremely detailed report on our manuscript. 
The edits that the referee requested were significant and indicated to us that we needed to rewrite some sections of the paper. 
This was a primary reason as to why it took us considerable time to return this revised manuscript to AiM.
While the edits were substantial, we do believe that the referee's suggestions greatly improved the readability and clarity of our results and we hope that shows in the revised work.
We attempted to address all the points that the referee brought to light in the original review, and we are very happy to make any other edits or changes that the referee sees fit. 

In the final section of this response we've summarized some important notation changes (inspired by the suggestions of the referee).
