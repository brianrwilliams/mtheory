\section{The non-minimal twist} 

We have provided numerous consistency checks that the 11-dimensional theory defined on a manifold with $SU(5)$ holonomy is a twist of supergravity. 
We have referred to this theory as minimal as it depends on the complex structure in the maximal number of directions. 
In this section we characterize a further twist of 11-dimensional supergravity from the lens of the holomorphic theory.  

On flat space, the further twist is essentially unique and renders the theory topological in seven directions, rather than just one as in the holomorphic twist. 
We will show that it is equivalent to a theory on $\CC^2 \times \RR^7$ that we call ``Poisson'' Chern--Simons theory. 
In the BV formalism, the theory $\ZZ/2$ graded and has fields given by
\[
A \in \Pi \Omega^{0,\bu}(\CC^2) \hotimes \Omega^\bu(\RR^7) ,
\]
where $\Pi$, as always, denotes parity shift.
The equations of motion are of the form
\[
\dbar A + \d_{\RR^7} A + \partial_{z} A \wedge \partial_{w} A = 0 .
\]
The action functional depends on the holomorphic symplectic structure on $\CC^2$ through the Poisson bracket on the algebra of holomorphic functions.
We give a precise definition below. 

The main result of this section is the following.

\begin{thm}
The non-minimal twist of the 11-dimensional theory is equivalent to Poisson Chern--Simons theory on 
\[
\CC^2 \times \RR^7 .
\]
\end{thm}

As a first consistency check, we can compare deformation invariants attached to the holomorphic twist and the $G2\times SU(2)$ twist. We will find that the local character of the latter agrees with a specialization of the local character computed in proposition \ref{prop:locchar}

\begin{prop}
The  local character of the $G2\times SU(2)$ twist of 11d supergravity on flat space is given by
\[
\chi_{SU(3)\times SU(2)}(\Obs_0^{\cE_{G2\times SU(2)}}) = \prod _{(n_1,n_2)\in \Z^2_{\geq 0}} \frac{1}{1-q^{-n_1+n_2}}.
\] 
This agrees with the specializaiton of the local character computed in proposition \ref{prop:locchar} at $y=1$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
The space of solutions to linearized equations of motion is parametrized by a holomorphic function $A$ on $\C^2_{w_j}$. The corresponding linear local operators are labeled by $(n_1,n_2)\in \Z^2_{\geq 0}$  and are given by 
\[
A_{(n_1,n_2)} : A \mapsto \partial_{w_1}^{n_1}\partial_{w_2}^{n_2} A (0).
\]

The character of the linear span of these is given by the geometric series
\[
\sum _{(n_1,n_2)\in \Z^2_{\geq 0}} q^{-n_1+n_2}
\] 
with plethystic exponential given by 
\[
\prod _{(n_1,n_2)\in \Z^2_{\geq 0}} \frac{1}{1-q^{-n_1+n_2}}.
\]

For the last part, it suffices to show that the characters of linear local operators agree upon evaluating $y=1$. Summing the geometric series giving the character of linear local operators in the holomorphic twist yields the rational function \[\frac{\left (\begin{aligned}t_1y^{-1} + t_1^{-1}t_2y^{-1} + t_2^{-1}y^{-1} + q^{-1}y^{\frac 3 2} + qy^{\frac 3 2} \\  - (t_1^{-1}y + t_1t_2^{-1}y + t_2y &+ q^{-1}y^{-\frac 3 2} + qy^{-\frac 3 2})\end{aligned}\right)}{(1-t_1^{-1}y)(1-t_1t_2^{-1}y)(1-t_2y)(1-q^{-1}y^{-3/2})(1-qy^{-3/2})}.\] Specializing $y=1$, the numerator cancels with the factors in the denominator involving the $t_i$. The result is \[\frac{1}{(1-q^{-1})(1-q)}\] which is exactly the sum of the geometric series we found

\end{proof}

%Notice that changing the values of $i,j$ just has the affect of permuting the holomorphic copies of $\CC^2$ leftover in the further twist. 

%The Lie algebra of gauge symmetries of this model on flat space is 
%\[
%\Omega^{0,\bu} (\CC_i \times \CC_j) \hotimes \Omega^\bu(\RR^7) 
%\]
%which is quasi-isomorphic to $\cO^{hol}(\CC^2)$ equipped with the Poisson bracket $\{-,-\}_{pb}$. 
%
%More generally, the twist can be defined \brian{finish}

\subsection{The non-minimal supercharge}

From the point of view of the untwisted theory, the non-minimal twist is defined by working in a background where the fermionic ghost in the physical theory is equal to a supertranslation of the form
\[
Q + Q_{nm} 
\]
where $Q$ is the supertranslation which defines the minimal twist, see \S \ref{sec:mintwist}.
The minimal twist of supergravity is obtained by setting a fermionic ghost equal to $Q$. 

In the language of the minimal twist, the supercharge $Q_{nm}$ determines a square-zero element in the $Q$-cohomology of the original supersymmetry algebra (which we will denote by the same letter). 
The characterization of this cohomology in Proposition \ref{prop:susycoh} implies that $Q_{nm}$ is an element 
\[
Q_{nm} \in \wedge^2 L 
\]
where $L \cong \CC^5$ is the defining $SU(5)$ representation. 
In other words, $Q$ is a translation invariant holomorphic two-form on $\CC^5$. 
The condition that $[Q_{nm}, Q_{nm}] = 0$ simply says that $Q_{nm}\wedge Q_{nm} = 0$ as a translation invariant four-form on $\CC^5$. 
By a linear change of coordinates, all such two-forms $Q$ are of the form $Q_{nm} = \d z_i \wedge \d z_j$ where $i,j=1,\ldots, 5$.

From hereon in this section we will rename coordinates by
\[
\CC^5 \times \RR = \CC^2_{z_i} \times \CC^3_{w_a} \times \RR
\]
which is most natural from the point of view of the non-minimal twist. 
We will fix the non-minimal supercharge 
\[
Q_{nm} = \d z_1 \wedge \d z_2 .
\]
Notice that this choice of supercharge breaks the holonomy of the 11-dimensional theory from $SU(5)$ to $SU(2)$. 

We constructed an embedding of the $Q$-cohomology of the supersymmetry algebra into the fields of our 11-dimensional theory on $\CC^5 \times \RR$. 
The further twist is obtained by working in a background where a certain field on $\CC^5 \times \RR$ takes nonzero value $Q_{nm}$. 
Explicitly, the element $Q_{nm} \in \wedge^2 L$ corresponds to the image under $\del$ of a $\gamma$-field of type $\Omega^{1,0}(\CC^5) \otimes \Omega^0(\RR)$. 
According to the embedding in \S \ref{s:residual} this is the $\gamma$-field 
\[
\gamma_{nm} = \frac12 (z_1 \d z_2 - z_2 \d z_1) \in \Omega^{1,0}(\CC^5) \otimes \Omega^0(\RR) 
\]
Notice that $\del \gamma_{nm} = \d z_1 \wedge \d z_2$ as desired.

\parsec[sec:nmsymmetry]
Before proceeding to the proof of the theorem above, we perform a simple calculation of the global symmetry algebra present in the $Q_{nm}$-twisted theory. 

Recall that up to a copy of constant functions, the global symmetry algebra of the holomorphic twist of the 11-dimensional theory is the super Lie algebra $E(5,10)$.
From this point of view, the global symmetry algebra of the $Q_{nm}$-twisted theory is given by deformation of this super Lie algebra by the Maurer--Cartan element 
\[
\d z_1 \wedge \d z_2 \in \Omega^{2}_{cl}(\CC^5) .
\]
We recall that the space of closed two-forms on $\CC^5$ is precisely the odd part of the super Lie algebra $E(5,10)$. 

We compute the cohomology of $E(5,10)$ with respect to the differential which is bracketing with this Maurer--Cartan element. 
Recall that we are using the holomorphic coordinates $(z_1,z_2,w_1,w_2,w_3)$ on $\CC^5$. 

There are the following brackets in the super Lie algebra $E(5,10)$ 
\begin{align*}
[f_l \partial_{z_l} , \d z_1 \wedge \d z_2] & = \del f_i \wedge \d z_j - \del f_j \wedge \d z_i \\
[g_a \partial_{w_a} , \d z_1 \wedge \d z_2] & = 0 \\
[h^{ab} \d w_a \wedge \d w_b , \d z_1 \wedge \d z_2 ] & = \ep_{abc} h^{ab} \partial_{w_c} .
\end{align*}
where $f_l \partial_{z_l}$, $g_a \partial_{w_a}$ are divergence-free vector fields on $\CC^5$ and $h^{ab} \d w_a \wedge \d w_b$ is a closed two-form. 

From these relations, we see that the following elements are in the kernel of $[\d z_1 \wedge \d z_2, -]$:
\begin{itemize}
\item $f(z_i) \partial_{z_1} + g(z_i) \partial_{z_2}$ for holomorphic functions $f,g$ on $\CC_{z_1} \times \CC_{z_2}$ which satisfy 
\[
\del_{z_1} f + \del_{z_2} g = 0 .
\]
In other words, this is a divergence-free vector field on $\CC_{z_1} \times \CC_{z_2}$. 
\item $f_b(z_i, w_a) \partial_{w_b}$ for $f_b$ a holomorphic function on $\CC^5$ where $b=1,2,3$. 
\end{itemize}
It is immediate to check that these are the only nonzero elements in the kernel. 
Further, any element of the second type is clearly exact by the closed two-form $\ep^{ijklm} f \d z_l \d z_m$. 

Thus, the cohomology is the (purely bosonic) Lie algebra of divergence-free vector fields on $\CC^2 = \CC_i \times \CC_j$
\[
H^\bu\big(E(5,10), [\d z_1 \wedge \d z_2, -] \big) \simeq \Vect_0(\CC^2) .
\]

We proved in Theorem \ref{thm:global} that the global symmetry algebra of the 11-dimensional theory on $\CC^5 \times \RR$ is equivalent to a central extension $\Hat{E(5,10)}$ of the super Lie algebra~$E(5,10)$. 

The Lie algebra of divergence-free vector fields on $\CC^2$ also admits a central extension:
\beqn\label{eqn:centralvect}
0 \to \CC \to \cO (\CC^2) \to \Vect_0 (\CC^2) \to 0
\eeqn
where $\cO(\CC^2)$ is equipped with the Poisson bracket with respect to the symplectic form~$\d z_1 \wedge \d z_2$.
These two central extension are compatible. 

%Thus, the Lie algebra of gauge symmetries of Poisson Chern--Simons theory on $\CC_i \times \CC_j \times \RR^7$ is a trivial one-dimensional central extension of the cohomology of $E(5,10)$. 

\begin{prop}
Let $\Hat{E(5,10)}$ be the central extension of $E(5,10)$ which is equivalent to the global symmetry algebra of the 11-dimensional theory on $\CC^5 \times \RR$. 
Then, there is an isomorphism of Lie algebras 
\[
H^\bu \big(\Hat{E(5,10)} , [\d z_1 \wedge \d z_2, -] \big) \simeq \cO(\CC^2) .
\]
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
The only thing to check is that, in cohomology, the cocycle defining the central extension of $E(5,10)$ is the cocycle exhibiting $\cO(\CC^2)$ as the central extension of divergence-free vector fields. 
Recall that the formula \eqref{eqn:cocycle} for the cocycle is 
\[
\varphi(\mu, \mu', \alpha) = \<\mu \wedge \mu', \alpha\>|_{z=0}.
\]

In cohomology, we obtain the cocycle for divergence-free vector fields by plugging in $\alpha = \d z_1 \wedge \d z_2$. 
This gives the cocycle on $\Vect_0(\CC^2)$ 
\[
(f_i \del_{z_i}, g_j \del_{z_j}) \mapsto (f_1 g_2 - f_2 g_1)(z_1=z_2=0) .
\]
This is the cocycle defining \eqref{eqn:centralvect}, as desired. 
\end{proof}

This proposition implies that the global symmetry algebra of the non-minimal twist of 11-dimensional supergravity is the Lie algebra $\cO(\CC^2)$. 
We will see that this is compatible with the calculation of the non-minimal twist of the full BV theory.

%Explicitly, if $f,g$ are holomorphic functions on $\CC^2$ then
%\[
%\{f(z_1,z_2) , g(z_1,z_2)\}_{pb} = \partial_{z_i} f \partial_{z_j} g - \partial_{z_j} f \partial_{z_i} g .
